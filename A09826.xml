            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A PREFACE TO the Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Oe heere I preſent vnto thee (gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Reader) a continuation of the booke of all the famous Battailes, fought in our age, and I doe hope with better hap than the firſt came forth, if the Printer haue done his dutie in reforming the faults noted and corrected in his proues. For as for the firſt part it was ſo maimed, mangled, and marred by the Printer, I will not ſaie of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but certes of pride and negligence, that I like a paſsio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate mother, that had her faire child foulie deformed through the negligence, or mallice of a lewde Nurſe, in manner for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſware mine owne child, bidding the Printer take it to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and father it on whom hee liſt, ſo he gaue it not mine name, for I would neuer acknowledge it for mine owne, but account it a changeling. But letting this matter paſſe, which is pleaſant neither for thee to heare, nor for me to rehearſe: perhaps you long to know what nouelties I do now bring: forſooth, certaine Battailes mentioned in the firſt parte, but not there deſcribed, becauſe I had then no good author to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that had ſet them forth at large, but all the reſt are bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes fought ſince the publication of the firſt part, vnleſſe it be two, which were ſet downe in the firſt booke, but ſince that time hauing chanced vppon farre larger and better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, I haue inſerted them in this later part. And doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les the battailes do deſerue a verie perticular &amp; exact deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as they which of al other were beſt fought: the firſt is the battel of Dreux in France, the other a battel in the leua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſeas,
<pb facs="tcp:15178:3"/>where the confederate Chriſtians, vnder the conduct of Don Iohn de Auſtria, diſcomfited the fleete and forces of the Turke: the which battaile I called in my firſt part, the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile of Lepanto, and now in my latter, the battaile of Peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherias, and no doubt in both places falſelie. For it was not fought in the gulfe of Lepanto, but in another gulfe neere therevnto, which you ſhall finde perticularlie deſcribed in this booke, but not named neither by mine author, nor by anie Geographer that I can light on: and therefore for lacke of a true name, I call it the battaile of Peſcherias, of the forelong that adioyneth to the gulfe, and where the two Nauies firſt deſcried each other, beeing then too neere to retire, without apparant perill, if either of them had had that cowardlie minde and intention.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, in the deſcription of euerie battaile, I haue, as alſo in the firſt part, followed alwayes ſome one certaine au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, whome I thought had beſt of all other done it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out enterlacing or adding of anie contradictions or ſcholies out of other writers, vnleſſe it be in the Portugall battailes: where to take awaie all coulour of quarrell from the capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, I haue adioyned notes out of the booke, intituled: The Explanation of the true and lawfull right of Anthonie king of Portugall, becauſe the common opinion is, that it was not publiſhed without the kings priuitie: and therefore I would haue made that booke my ſole author in the enarration of thoſe battailes, if it had perticularlie at large deſcribed them, as it doth but ſummarilie touch them. But the reaſon why I did not the like in the reſt is: firſt, becauſe I would auoide confuſion (for hardlie ſhall you finde two authors that doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in the deſcription of one battaile,) and ſecondarilie and principallie, becauſe I would not be reputed the author of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie thing ſet down in this booke, but onelie the bare tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor &amp; reporter of it in Engliſh: leauing the credite of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars in theſe books vnto their authors, whoſe names I haue prefixed in the front of euerie battaile, as alſo I haue done
<pb facs="tcp:15178:3"/>in the table. So that if any vntruth ſhalbe here found (which God forbid) the fault is not mine, vnleſſe I haue bene vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduiſed, and careleſſe in the choice of myne auctors: the which I hope I am farre from. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore courteous Reader, ſeing that I haue taken paines for to pleaſure and profit thee, ſpeake well of mee, and ſo fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well.</p>

                  <hi>17.</hi> of Dece<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber come to the ſide of the towne of <hi>Dreux,</hi> &amp; the riuer of <hi>Eure,</hi> within two litle leagues of the prince, who by an inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient ouerſight (which yet was the falt of the Marſhals of the camp) lodged y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> night with the battaile at <hi>Yuoy,</hi> beyond &amp; more néere to the enimie by one league, then the auantgard lead by the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, who had his quartier at the village of <hi>Neron,</hi> but the next daie the Admirall repairing vnto the Prince, it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gréed vpon that the daie following the auantgard ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times march forth beyond the lodging, and battaile of the Prince, and ſo take againe their old &amp; due order &amp; range, and by this time had all the Catholikes paſſed the water, the which when the confederats vnderſtood, ſome of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thought that the battaile would be preſentlie preſented them: but the Admirall was of another opinion, becauſe the Sun was not then aboue an houre &amp; a halfe high, and thervpon euerie man fell to fantaſying &amp; imagining the good &amp; the ill, the which might come of ſo great a maſſe of occurrents, which were preſented on the one ſide &amp; the other: and ſéeing that the moſt part aſſured themſelues, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſome notable battaile would be fought, euerie man iudged of the euent thereof, according to his knowledge &amp; practiſe in the feates of armes. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe feare in ſome, heate in other, &amp; ignorance in diuerſe, made their iudgements ſo diuerſe, that it was a wonder to ſee it. Many marked on the parte of the Proteſtants two faults, ſo much the more to bée blamed, as they are of great conſequence, and yet ordinarie with the warriours of this age and time. The firſt was, that no man was ſent forth to ſuruey and take view of the enimie, for the Catholikes, which the Proteſtants might ſée, were gone to ſound y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> foord
<pb facs="tcp:15178:6"/>that they might then paſſe ouer their armie preſentlie, or els that night, as in truth they did. The ſecond fault was, that in liew of going to lodge in the good and ſtrong villages néere the riuer, and the which the Catholikes ſeized the next daie, euerie man returned to his quarter, whereby the night following the Catholikes had meanes inough to paſſe the water, &amp; to lodge themſelues in the villages about to their aduantage, there being ſo little order &amp; good looking to things on the Princes ſide, that he was neuer aduertiſed thereof, although there was ſcarcelie two leagues of ground be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene the two armies. Likewiſe alſo many of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes did iudge that their Chieftaines did manifeſtlie amiſſe in this, that they did prepare themſelues to giue battaile directlie in a place where the Campaine of <hi>Beauſe</hi> did end, conſidering that al their force was in their footmen, and the Princes in his horſemen: wherevnto adde the great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of wagons that the Reiſters carrie with them: it being a thing of certaintie, that if they had let the Prince paſſe to the borough of <hi>Trion,</hi> as he pretended, he ſhuld haue had ſuch déepe and hollow waies, both on this ſide, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond, and in paſſing further ſhould haue found the Countrie ſo full of trées, that the Catholikes might with the third part onelie of their footmen haue defeated the Prince, and taken all his cariages without anie hazard, and another thing there was (ſaie they) which made their falt more in excuſable, that ſéeing they were maiſters of all the Countrie of <hi>Norman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die</hi> on this ſide and beyond the riuer of <hi>Seine,</hi> it was in their power to conſtraine the Prince to yéeld himſelfe to their mercie, or elſe to driue him backe euen to the gates of <hi>Orleans,</hi> without hazarding of themſelues anie whit at all.</p>
               <p>The Prince (hauing in that, better iudgement than the Admirall) armed himſelfe two houres before daie, &amp; ſigned many diſpatches to be ſent into <hi>Albemaigne,</hi> &amp; other places fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence he hoped great ſuccors wold come, &amp; becauſe the auantgard which was to come fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Neron</hi> ſéemed to be ſlow, (wherof y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prince complained much) he ſent many gentlemen
<pb facs="tcp:15178:7"/>one after another for to haſten them, but for all that euer he could do, it was farre forth daies before that they came. So then at length his armie marched, but after the accuſtomed manner, without aduertiſing the companies perticularly, to prepare themſelues to the battaile, either by ſolempne ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, or perticular, or by anie other aduertiſements, than a few wordes, ſhort, but verie couragious, and with a good grace: inſomuch that many Gentlemen found themſelues diſarmed when they ſhould go to the charge, &amp; fought with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either harneſſe on their backe, or helmet on their head, of this armie parted into two bodies of men of armes, the vantgard lead by the Admiral had about <hi>305.</hi> French horſe, foure Cornets of Reiſters, ſixe Enſignes of Almaines, and twelue of French men: the battaile, whereof the Prince had the conduct, contained <hi>450.</hi> lances Frenchmen, ſixe Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets of Reiſters, ſixe Enſignes of Almaines, and twelue of Frenchmen, beſides ſixe cornets of Argoulets, which might ſerue for light horſe, vnder the conduct of <hi>La Curec,</hi> but they had not marched aboue a leage and a halfe, when the vant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courers aduertiſed the Admirall that they had diſcouered on this ſide the water a great troupe of horſe: whome he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing commanded them to aſſaile at a ſignall giuen as they did) with aſſurance that himſelfe would follow them at the héeles, ſodainlie the battaile which the Conſtable lead ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared at the ſide of a village. The which being reported to the Admirall, and afterward to the Prince, they cauſed all their horſemen to ſet their launces vpright, ranging their battailes within a good Culuerine ſhot of them. Afterward ſéeing that their enimies came not forth, they two went fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with only <hi>Dandelut</hi> (who had a third daie Ague, &amp; was mounted on an hackney, &amp; apparelled for all harneſſe with a furred robe) vntill they came to a place, from whence they might eaſilie iudge who had the aduauntage of the place, whereby they were perſwaded that it was not for them to aſſaile the enimie whereas he was, that is to wit, at the head of a village betwéene <hi>Nogent</hi> and <hi>Lormay,</hi> towardes the which place the Countrie ſéemed to be plaine, but it was
<pb facs="tcp:15178:7"/>not ſo indéede, but they muſt néeds go vp an hill and downe againe: inſomuch that the Prince to paſſe ouer his men, and to auoide the furie of their artilerie, wherwith all they were well furniſhed, was forced to haſten his people to march ſo faſt that he put them out of breath, but becauſe they marched ſlowlie, they abid at the leaſt thrée volées of their péeces, which might make a great checke and affright the armie, in the which not all men had their eares accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to the ſound of ſuch flutes. Furthermore, the armie Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike did couer ſo great a compaſſe of ground, that if they encountered in that place, one part of them might compaſſe in, and charge the Prince in the ſide, and ſo by that meanes he being incloſed, ſhould bée at the mercie of his enimies. Theſe things being conſidred, and preſuppoſing alſo that the Catholikes were not verie ſharplie ſet to fight, a reſolution was take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to go directly for to lodge at <hi>Trion,</hi> following y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> they had when they departed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Ormoy,</hi> &amp; thether were the Marſhals of the lodgings ſent. The better to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent vnto you one of the moſt renowmed battailes that euer was fought in this Realme, I will firſt figure out vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you the ſeate and qualitie of the place, which afterward was embrued w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the bloud of ſo many gallant men. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward I will ſet as it were before your eies, the eſtate and diſpoſition wherein theſe two armies maintained them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues before, during, and after the conflict. Which béeing done, yée may eaſilie iudge, to whom the aduantage of one ſo notable occurance ought to be giuen, vpon the end of the league and leuell champains of <hi>Beauſe, Nogent le Roy</hi> doth preſent it ſelfe to <hi>Normandie,</hi> pretie néere to <hi>Dreux,</hi> a little towne at the foote of an hill (wherevpon ſtands a Caſtle of ſufficient ſtrength within the towne, by the ſide whereof paſſeth the riuer) a Countrie fertile &amp; well peopled, betwéen the which two Countries that are ſeparated by the courſe of <hi>Eure</hi> (the which comming out of <hi>Beauſe</hi> for to water <hi>Chartres,</hi> doth trauerie <hi>No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:15178:8"/>Towneſhippes, of whome the Catholickes had alwaies to that daye, kept the aduantages, as they that ſéeing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſtronger in footemen, and weaker in horſemen then the Prince, would not hazard ought, but where the place did fauour footemen, for lacke of whome the Prince was conſtrained to take a contrarie courſe. The which was the cauſe that at his parting from <hi>Lormoy</hi> néere <hi>Nogent,</hi> he had purpoſed to take <hi>Dreux,</hi> more for to force the Catholickes to an open and generall fight, then for the importaunce of the place: where <hi>Sourdeual</hi> commanded, with an hundreth light horſe, and fiue Enſignes of footemen. But the Cheif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines Catholickes followed him, (coaſting alwaies) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in fiue or ſixe leagues, but holding their waye thorough countries ſo ſtrong and ſuch couerts, that the Prince could not finde any poſſibilitie to encounter them, but with his diſaduantage. And in the ende the Catholickes ſéeing oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions and meanes to preuaile in that countrie, by reaſon of the great number of their footemen, reſolued for to fight: and therefore the .xix. daye, did ſet forward to get before the Proteſtants, and if they could get to <hi>Dreux</hi> before the Prince, there to offer him battaile at the head of the towne vpon an high péece of ground, lodging in the village two great Bataillons of footemen, which garded xiiii. Canons, placed and preſt to play before them, and a little before on the ſide a number of <hi>Enfans perdus,</hi> whome they had choſen out of all the Regiments. The two flankes of theſe Batail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons were two great troupes of horſemen, for mutuall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſuccour of the footemen and horſemen, as was beſt for their behoofe. Moreouer, they had choſen a place ſo fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, that the Confederates could not charge neither thone nor the other, but by one way of a xiiii. or xv. hundreth pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the which alſo the Herquebuzes Catholicke, did no leſſe ſcoure, then dyd their Artillerie. Alſo a little below, they had a ſmall vnwalled towne for to gard their baggage, &amp; the Riuer of <hi>Eure</hi> néere to their back. But being reſolute, &amp; hot to fight, they aduanced themſelues farther, for to get betwen two Villages, by a woods ſide, with far greater aduantage
<pb facs="tcp:15178:8"/>then before. Herevpon the Prince following his reſolution, bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to turne head towards <hi>Trion,</hi> ſhewing his right ſide to his enimies, who perceuing the Argolets, &amp; one eſquadro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Reiſters to be a faire marke, diſcharged vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one volée of great Ordenance, which did affraie them in ſuch ſort, that almoſt all the Argolets ran awaye, &amp; the Reiſters tooke the way in a litle valley for to couer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Canon ſhot. Wherevpon <hi>Anna de Montmorency</hi> Conſtable of <hi>France,</hi> &amp; general of that Armie, taking occaſion to goe to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> charge, for to ouerthrow &amp; break the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all intirely (as he had aſſured many y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> his owne battel alone was more then ſufficient for to ouerthrow all the Proteſtant Armie) cauſed the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal of his troupes to come néere to him, vnto whome he made ſuch a like ſpeach.</p>
               <p>At the length (my maiſters &amp; friends) I haue brought you within ſight of our enimies, who haue alwaies hether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to made ſemblance that they ſought battel, the which now they cannot flye, but alſo with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loſſe thereof, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequentlie of all the reſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> they haue &amp; poſſeſſe in <hi>France.</hi> For whether ye be aſſailants, or defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dants, the aduantage is aſſured you, as well for number of men, that doubleth theirs, for the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der &amp; diſpoſition of the Armie, for the qualities of the armes &amp; furniture, as alſo for the commoditie of the places, which fauoreth vs in all ſorts, if they wil come to vs. Adde there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto a thing more conſiderable, that we doe maintaine the cauſe of God, who wil haue but one Religion in the world, that is to wit, the au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cient Catholick <hi>Romane,</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the which theſe meſcreans &amp; infidels haue lewdely cut of themſelues: we doe alſo vphold y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> partie of our king &amp; ſoueraigne prince, who cannot permit other exerciſe in his Realme, then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> of his predeceſſours: &amp; finally, we fight for the weale of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trie, for the ſuertie whereof, we hauing euer to this day done infinit exploites, &amp; fought in ſo many places, with ſuch honour and profit, as your vertuous and holie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires haue deſerued: we ſhould now be of leſſe beléefe then they are, and more timorous then women, if we ſhould not aſſure vs all, that this acte as the laſt of ſo manie trauailes
<pb facs="tcp:15178:9"/>paſſed, ſhall be crowned with the good honor and felicitie that all good and couragious people cannot but deſire. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, thinke ye y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we are not héere to quarrel for other mens lands, nor for the defence of the borders of anie Lordes, nor to enlarge the Empire of the Crowne of <hi>France,</hi> but for the ſaluation of our ſoules, for the maintenance of the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our anceſtors, for the holie alters, for the ſacred reliks, for the reuerent Prieſts, and the wonderfull and awefull myſteries of our Religion. In ſum, it is for the honour of Jeſus Chriſt, and then ſecondarilie for the conſeruation of our owne liues, and of the life of our Prince, and of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, and by a conſequent, for the honour, good, and ſuretie of the ſtate, the which theſe miſchiouous heretikes would no leſſe reuerſe, than they haue done alreadie our true and Catholike faith ſo defiled by the mortall venim of their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiferous hereſies. We might well haue haſtned the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, but that the counſaile haue alwaies bene of aduiſe for to ſtaie for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of all our forces, as wel naturals, as alies and ſtrangers, for to make them all pertakers of the preſent honour attended of all, yet neuertheleſſe rather remitted than denied anie one of you. Wherefore aſſure your ſelues of the victorie, if ye do not beelie and denie your valour héeretofore: march reſolutelie to the fight, kéepe wel your rankes, ſuccour one another as ſhal be néedfull, holde your ſelues certaine and aſſured that this one daie will bée the beginning of your honourable libertie, and of a treble miſerable bondage of the enimies of God, of the king, and of all good people.</p>
               <p>But now he had cauſed the Artilerie to plaie vppon the formoſt of the Proteſtants, who were therewithall ſo gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and affrighted, that many going out of the rankes, made them beléeue that their Generall refuſed the battaile for to gaine ſtill ground: which cauſed them to begin to make to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the troupes of the Prince, who ſhewed vnto them his ſide with a diſmarch, and an araie and appearaunce ſo proude, that the armie ſhewed how great Captaines dyd leade it. The Catholike armie was compaſſed of fiue
<pb facs="tcp:15178:9"/>fiue great battailons of footemen, intermedled and interla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſtill with their horſemen, becauſe they were weaker than the Princes horſes, as their footmen were ſtronger by a treble. The Catholike armie ſéemed to bée diuided into partes, rather in the reſpect of the Chieftaines that gouerned it, than for anie difference of troupes (as the ancient faſhion was to diuide an armie into an auantgard, a battaile and a rereward) for the Catholikes repreſented the forme of an hedge, the which béeing bias, high, low, ſtraight, and crooked, according to the nature of the places where they ſtood, made the confederates to ſée more or leſſe the bands Catholyke, according as the nature of the paſſage did permit, wherein the thrée chiefe Captaines ſeemed to bée well accomoded and placed, either to receiue, or to giue the charge in this battaile. If you will call the troupes lead by the Marſhall of Saint <hi>Andre,</hi> the auantgard, it was compoſed of nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>téene companies of men of armes Frenchmen, thirteene en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes of Spaniards, ſo many of French, and eleauen of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, with foure péeces of Artillerie, all placed on the left of the Conſtable, who béeing chiefe of the armie, lead the battaile, which was néerer the enimie than all the reſt of the troupes, and it conſiſted of xvii. Eſtanders of men of armes, three of horſemen, xxii. enſignes of Suiſſes, and xvii. of Frenchmen and Britons, with eight péeces of Artillerie. The Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> lead the rereward for to helpe the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currents which might be preſented, but had but a few men: they almoſt all ſtanding on the right ſide of the Conſtable, who ſtoode formoſt of them all, and euerie one of the thrée Chieftaines hauing before them their <hi>Enfans Perdus</hi> on foot to begin the game. The ſumme of their armie amounted to <hi>19000.</hi> footemen, and <hi>2000.</hi> horſemen, and the Prince was about <hi>4000.</hi> horſemen, all apparelled in white Caſaques, the which the Prince had cauſed them to weare for a marke of the pureneſſe of their conſcience in the deſſigne by them made for to maintaine the honour of God, and the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, with <hi>6000.</hi> footemen diuided into two battaillens of Almaines and Frenchmen.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:15178:10"/>
               <p>Then the armie Catholike marching in this order a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Princes, that ſhewed them his ſide, ariued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene two villages <hi>L'Eſpine,</hi> and <hi>Blainuille,</hi> diſtant aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>1200.</hi> pace. The which ſpace not béeing capable to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the armie Catholike in length, it happened that the battel Catholike was farre beyond the auantgard Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant, ſo that it ſtoode much behinde it. Wherefore the Prince imagining that they marched directlie to him for to fight, hée without farther leaſure to make publike pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to God for the victorie, as the Pariſians did (that made the ſhrine of Saint <hi>Geneuiefue</hi> to come downe, for to emploie her as an interceſſereſſe to God for their behoofe) made his troupes tourne head with as much ſpéede as hée could: but as a whole armie is not eaſilie remoued, ſo ſpecially by Chieftaines, that haue alwayes made more of the eſtate of actions of the bodie, than of the ſpirit, and wit, priſing higher a furious valliance, ſhan an order and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raie militarie, (whereby the troupes accuſtomed to tourne, and change in all ſortes, and in a moment, doe carrie awaie moe victories without great loſſe, than all thoſe hardie and outragious feeſes, the which cannot bring but a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie irreparable) the diſorder ſhewed it ſelfe to bée ſuch, that the Admirall and the auantgard found themſelues ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right againſt the Conſtable, and the Battaile: and the Prince and his battaile that was oppoſed and ſet agaynſt the auantgard of the Catholikes, was ſo farre behinde it, as wée ſayde, that the Prince coulde ſcarce ſée it at all. Moreouer, the onelie battaile of the Conſtable ſtretched almoſt as farre in length as all the whole armie of the Prince. And for lacke of order, if that the conſtant reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome had not ſerued for an example vnto the reſt of the armie, the Proteſtants had béene that daie the more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happie. In ſumme, that backwardneſſe was the cauſe, that the Prince and the Conſtable bare all the brunt, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables horſemen that ſtrengthned his battaillon béeing charged at one end by the Admirall, and the Battaillon of the Suiſſes that made the other ende, by the Prince, as I
<pb facs="tcp:15178:10"/>will tell you.</p>
               <p>But as the troupes of the horſemen Proteſtant were ſeuered in diuerſe ſmall Battaillons of two or thrée com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies Frenchmen, with as manye or moe Reiſters on their ſide, ſo they made diuerſe charges. And to ſet the battaile abroach, the Prince ſet forth out of a little valley, wherevpon he marched, and reſolued to go to the charge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that the Artillerie of the Catholikes being well leuel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, lighted among his bandes, with great ſlaughter of good men, as well of one Nation as of the other: but in ſtead of going directlie againſt the auantgard Catholike, which was farre from him, hée left it on his left hand, tourning head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſide of the eſquadron of the Suiſſes which ſtren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened the end and vttermoſt ſide of the battaile of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable, the which ſome went about to diſſwade him from, as well becauſe he ſhould thereby leaue all the auantgard of the enimie whole, who might charge him on the backe or ſide at their pleaſure, as alſo becauſe his footemen tarried thereby behinde all naked, and abandoned to the mercie of the reſt of the Catholikes. Moreouer, ſeeing that he was the ſtronger in horſemen, he ought not to aſſaile the footmen of the enimies, who would of themſelues either break, or yéeld ſhortlie after, if the horſemen of the Catholikes were defai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but the heate of the Prince pricked him forward to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and inconueniences, which yée ſhall ſée. For hauing aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled the principal chiefe men of the armie, with the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall of <hi>Heſſen,</hi> and certaine other that vnderſtoode French, for to report afterward the ſubſtaunce of that hée ſhoulde ſaie, vnto their Captaines and ſouldiers, hée ſpake to this effect.</p>

               <p>This being done, euery man returned to his troupe, to encourage them by the ſame reaſons that they had learned of the Prince: whereof they had no ſooner aſſured the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to their people, but they dyd ſet them all in araye, for to folow their chieftaines, in the ſame order, and with ſuch diſmarch as I will tell you.</p>
               <p>Firſt and formoſt <hi>Mouy,</hi> with his troupe incorporated with <hi>Danaretts,</hi> the ſucceſſor of <hi>Genlys,</hi> (both of them being of the Auantgard, prepared for the firſt ſhockes) were alſo the firſt that charged the Suiſſes in the flanke, with ſuch force, that being reſolutely entred their ranks, they paſſed thorough them trauerſe. The Prince that folowed them, not onely pierced their bataillon, but alſo brake all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole taile with great mortalitie of thoſe footemen, as good pike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men as they were. The Reiſters that folowed, gaue in alſo after him, and dyd a meruailous execution. The which <hi>Danuille,</hi> who was with thrée companies of men of armes
<pb facs="tcp:15178:12"/>and the light horſe, betwéene the Bataillons of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Suiſſes, &amp; Almans ſéeing, did ſet foorth for to make head to the Prince, but two cornets of Reiſters ſetting vpon him, did breake him in ſuch ſort, that he was forced to retire himſelfe to the Auantgard Catholicke, which was a good diſtance of, which yet remained ſtill firme. In this encounter was <hi>Monbron,</hi> one of the Conſtables ſonnes ſlaine by an Eſquire of the Prince, who had promiſed it him before <hi>Paris.</hi> Vpon theſe diſmarches, <hi>Rochefoucaut</hi> with about an hundreth lances, who were alſo of the troupe of the Prince, who hadde not thought it good to leaue their footemen without ſuccour, was alſo conſtrained to take the ſame courſe, &amp; charged the Suiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in the front, whome he found ſo cloſe together, &amp; ſo well prouided of courage, or perhaps not diſmarching with ſuch reſolution as the Prince did, and therefore could not break them, gained nothing but thruſts of the pike, although he ſlew ſome, and among them the Colonnell.</p>
               <p>On thother ſide, at the verie ſame inſtaunt that the Prince charged, the Admirall with two cornettes of Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters that were on his right ſide, marched with his owne regiment, and the troupe of the Prince of <hi>Portian</hi> directly to the Conſtable his Vnckle, and ſeuen or eight ſtanders of men of armes, that ſtrengthned the other ende of the batail Catholicke. And after he hadde borne one vollée of their Artillerie, and certaine Harqueburiers <hi>Enfans perdus,</hi> that endamaged them a good litle, brake all that he encountred, notwithſtanding anie reſiſtaunce that could be made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him.</p>
               <p>Many dyd then their beſt, but their number was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing equall to them, that made more deere accompt of lyfe then of honour, and who béeing better prouided of good ſpurres, then aſſured of heart, fledde with ſuch ſpéede that a great number were the next daye at the gates of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> by eight of the clocke in the morning, crying that all was loſt.</p>

Vpon this the Prince of <hi>Portian</hi> ſonne of the Counteſſe of <hi>Seniguan,</hi> to whome the Conſtable hadde done many diſpleaſures, came to him: But (as he was of a good and gentlemanly nature) in ſteed of his piſtolle, offered him his hand, promiſing him all help and fauour.</p>
               <p>The Bataillon compoſed of xvii. Enſignes of French men and Bretons that ſided the Suiſſes, were eaiely bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and ſo all the whole battaile of the Conſtable was ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and entirely defaited after a great ſlaughter of men, the reſt that fledde were purſued euen to the Riuer, where many were drowned, whiles that they that were more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of botie then of honor, rifeled the bagage, which was almoſt all ſpoiled.</p>
               <p>Herevpon the Lanſquenets of the Prince, ſéeing ſo great a foile fallen on the Suiſſes, would alſo lift vppe their hands, and doe alſo ſome thing on their partie, worthie of memorie vpon them, namely, whome they ſaw as men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtonied after two ſo furious eſcheckes, to reſt halfe broken, attending their entire miſchaunce: beſide an olde deadly hatred that they had borne againſt that nation, with whom they haue long contended for honor, the which neuer theleſſe the Suiſſes doe carie awaye from all the footemen of the worlde. So then they diſmarched towards the Suiſſes, who were now cloſed together againe, notwithſtanding all that had bene done before, but ſo faintly, that as ſoone as they ſawe that the Suiſſes that were left, did in ſtéede of being diſmayed, buſkle themſelues to goe ſtraight to them, they loſt their harts, flying without giuing one puſh with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pike. The which gaue occaſion at the ſame time to two cornetts of Reiſters, and certaine French horſes that were rallied, to giue a newe charge on thoſe Suiſſes. But in déede they found them ſo luſtie and of ſo haughtie courage, by reaſon
<pb facs="tcp:15178:13"/>of the flight of thoſe that durſt not ſo much as looke them in the face, that they could not wholie breake them, but their front remained ſtill whole, and made countenance to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer their eight péeces of Artillerie, which they had forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and with the which they might bring great domage to the troupes, that the Prince and the Admiral rallied with all diligence and ſpéede: Wherefore for to méete with, and fullie to defaite the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that vanted that they could not be, van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed by reaſon of their courage, their araie, &amp; martial diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline (whereof other Nations being ignorant, for the moſt part make ſo light account of) they were againe attached ſo luſtilie, that they were forced to leaue all to the vnreſiſtable furie of the deſperate French, before whome they fledde in ſmall bandes, yet neuertheleſſe hoped to rallie and to ſight againe. And in truth they did retire in good number, and with ſome order towards the auantgard, ſundrie times ten or a douſen of them that remained behinde ioyning toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and defending themſelues with ſtones (which was all the weapons that many of them had left them) euen to the death, in ſuch ſort, that neuer Nation did better than they did this daie. All the time of theſe hot attaches, the auant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard Catholike kept themſelues cloſe together, and ſtirred not one foote for the ſpace of about an houre and an halfe, beholding with a diſcontented eie the euents of ſo me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Moreouer, hée knew that their batthillon of French footemen, amounting to <hi>500.</hi> ill armed, and deſtitute of horſemen (who nowe went about to rallie with them) was not able to abide him, béeing reſolued to die, or elſe to carrie awaie the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

               <p>Vpon this reſolution, and béeing well followed by theſe troupes, hée charging on all partes this Bataillon of foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, had a faire daie, they béeing firſt retired, that ſhould haue conducted other, and as well by wordes as Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manlike examples of their perſons, haue encouraged them
<pb facs="tcp:15178:15"/>to doe their beuoire, and afterward all the Souldiours, but not ſo ſpéedelie as they could, becauſe they were on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe, and the other on ſoote, ſo that none of them fought, but the thrée or foure of the firſt rankes, after they had ſhot off one volée of their foure field yéeces. At the ſame time the Marſhall of Saint <hi>Andre,</hi> with all the reſt of his horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, went to range with the two ſides of the battaillon of the Almans, which did cloſe vp the vtter bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of the auant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard. In the front whereof were ſeauen or eight hundreth French Harquebuziers, ſhooting at the Reiſters, which had rallied themſelues returning from the chaſe of thoſe that had béene broken, as I tolde you before: Who ſéeing their French footemen, and Lanſquenets defaited, and ſo greate forces comming againſt them, retourned with a pretie trot towardes a woode that was néere them. In the meane while <hi>Dandelot,</hi> although hée were preſſed with his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, yet hée forced himſelfe to giue order for all thinges that were néedfull. And ſéeing thoſe Lanſquenets of the Prince to flie croſſe the village of <hi>Blaynuille,</hi> néere where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto the Conſtable had béene taken, hée gallopped to cut of their waie, and to make them make head to a troupe of horſemen, that chaſed them a good waie off: but they had no order once to ſtaie, they were ſo afrighted, it being moſt certaine, that theſe fiftie yéeres there entered not into <hi>France</hi> more errant cowardes than they were, although they had the faireſt apparaunce in the worlde. So that <hi>Dandelot,</hi> with whome abode not aboue ſeauen or eight horſes, and who by reaſon of his age had no other armour than a furred Cloake, could not reioyne with his fellowes, but retired without great impeachment towards <hi>Trion,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a place where he repoſed and reſted himſelfe as he could, finding meanes the next daie to get againe to the armie both finelie and fortunatelie.</p>
               <p>Vpon this the Prince and the Admiral ſéeing the auant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard alſo to come vppon them, who hadde not yet rallyed moe than about two hundred Frenchmen, of whome one onelie hadde a Launce, praied the Reiſters to ſtaie

Moreouer when they ſaw their footemen both French and Allemans ranne away, &amp; themſelues purſuen, they flung away a galloppe, and the French men with them: ſo that the Prince was conſtrained to doe ſo likewiſe, &amp; was hurt in the hand, &amp; his horſe, that had receaued an Harquebuſſe ſhot in his legge, had not gone aboue <hi>300.</hi> pace, but that he halted downe right, and before he could be remounted O. <hi>Anuille</hi> was on the backe of him, to whome he yéelded. The Reiſters and the French men, hauing croſſed a woode cut downe, found a little valley the which they paſſed, &amp; ſtayed vpon an high péece of ground in the ſight of the Admiral: who had taken his flight more on the right hande, with a number of other a long the ſide of the ſame wood, to make head to their enimies, that cloſed it vpon thother ſide, and both thone &amp; thother were aboue a good quarter of an houre without other aduauncing, or making in one to thother, wherein a number of Catholickes curious quite to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw thenimie, noted a groſſe fault committed by S. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Guyſe,</hi> aſſuring that if they had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uely folowed their victorie, the Proteſtants trembling at ſuch fearefull accidents, would neuer haue rallyed together in groſſe. But the Admirall, as a wiſe, reſolute, and diligent Capitaine, had done all that he could poſſible to rallye his horſemen diſperſed thorough the whole field, and in great diſorder, and finding that he had aſſembled about <hi>250.</hi> hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes French, that had nothing but their ſwords &amp; piſtolles, and about <hi>1000.</hi> Reiſters, of whome he ſet thone halfe on his right ſide, and thother on his left, and being accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Prince of <hi>Portian, Rochfoucaut,</hi> and other gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, well deliberated, he reſolued to goe yet once more to fight with thenimie, what price ſo euer if ſhold coſt him, after that he had vſed a few words to the Chiefe men of the Horſemen, that accompanied him, and the Marſhall of <hi>Heſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen,</hi> the Truchmen, and certaine Captaines Allemains, that vnderſtoode French, for to encourage them the better to the

               <p>Although it ſéemeth to mée a matter néedeleſſe to vſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie ſpeach to them that haue ſufficient aſſurance in their owne vertue and valour, and to make tryall whereof ye are come: yet whileſt we doe ſtay vntill all our people be rallied, I may well ſaye vnto you, that vnleſſe great enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes were accompanied with great perills and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the praiſe could be but ſmall to them that ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to the honour of them. But as the high deſſeines for to maintaine the honour of God, and the good of theyr Countrie, can not be executed without infinite bazardes, and paines incredible, ſo muſt they alſo aſſure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, that the price and rewarde of ſo manie extreame labours is not onelie preſt and certaine, but alſo great, when the vertue is great whereof we conſtantlie pourſue the end. This is the reaſon, why that hearts that would be knowen to be gentlemanly, doe alwayes pourpoſe and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt enterpriſes of great hazard, becauſe that they doe know that héereby they ſhall gette them eternall honour, and their long trauailes be recogniſed with immortall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne.</p>
               <p>On the contrarie part, thoſe that are of ſmall ſtomacke, baſelie minded, and of a vile cowardiſe, doe neuer addreſſe themſelues but to things baſe and eaſie, as alſo their name doeth dye as ſoone as the effect of that they enterpriſed. Moreouer, as aſſurance of the will of God is neceſſarie for to teſtifie all actions, can we fight more lawfully, or for a thing of ſo great importaunce, then for the libertie of our conſcience, (and doe they not take away the bright light of the worlde, that will take from vs the libertie of our faith) or can wée kéepe warres more iuſt then this which is of neceſſitie? Be not our weapons forced, and therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently holy and religious in the handes of them, that haue no other hope to liue, but by the helpe and endeuour of them? In, in, valiant hearts, In, in. It is not the multitude, but the valour of courage, that giueth the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:15178:16"/>
               <p>God fighteth for vs, as he hath done heretofore for ſo manie ſmall troupes, which you haue ſéene, and heard of, being well conducted to haue broken thoſe, that were ten times greater then themſelues. And otherwiſe alſo ye ſhall mightely enrich your ſelues as well by the incredible boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and ſpoile, as for the great raunſomes, that ye ſhall get. As touching the reſt, ye haue alreadie vanquiſhed the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part, which are rallied with them, that durſt not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunce themſelues vppon vs after the taking of their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall. Is it likely to be true, that they which haue bene alreadie tamed, and ſubdued, haue taken force by their fall? and that the victorious haue ben made more vile &amp; worſe by their felicitie? March then reſolutely to the defaite of the reſt, folowing the good houre that hath louingly welcomed you. It is a common ſaying, he that hath begon well hath halfe done, which is not ſpoken to make ſlouthfull or to bring a ſléepe him whoſe firſt attempts haue bene happie: no but contrarie for to prick him forward ſtill ſo much the more to the pourſuit and perfecting of his deſſeine. But as it is more diſhonor for him that through negligence or lack of courage doth let the ſatiſfaction &amp; contentment to be loſt, the which he had almoſt thoroughly gotten, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for him that had alwaies bene infortunate at the beginning, in the pourſuite, and at the ende of his enterpriſe: ſo you muſt aſſure your ſelues, that God dyd not ſend into your hands the beginning of ſo renowmed victorie through the ſtrange hardineſſe, and not credible valoure of my Lord the Prince, but for to heate and enchafe you to attempt the aduaunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and entier gaine of accompliſhed happineſſe.</p>
               <p>O thriſe fortunate, ye that ſhall retourne vnto your houſes triumphing of the victorie, loaden with the ſpoiles of your enimies, which ye ſhall bring out of the field, and ſée your ſelues embraſed, and ſwéetely welcomed home by your kinſfolkes, wiues, children, neighbours, and allies, who ſhall for euer from Father to ſonne ſing the eternall praiſes of you, that haue ſo willniglie expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed your liues for the honour and glorie of God, ſuretie
<pb facs="tcp:15178:17"/>of the king, and publick good of your countrie. For although to die be a thing common both to the good and the wicked, whatſoeuer they be, yet death is not honorable, nor worthie of praiſe in any man, but in thoſe, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſhot at no other marke then the vertuous actions of their life. Goe then my mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and ſhew thenimie by effect, that our courage redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth in aduerſities, making them to know that with the loſſe of our braue companions, we will reuenge the woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and taking of our Generall. March then forward gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly and luſtely, and as they that doe fight with heartie hatred, making all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world ſée, that as Germanie &amp; France are two Nations of one originall, ſo that thone can not bring foorth more reſolute ſouldiours then the other.</p>
               <p>Thus they being all encouraged, marched directly to the village of <hi>Blaineuille,</hi> wher the firſt fight was made. There the Catholickes were in great number ranged in thrée eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quadrons, manie of whome imagined a while, that the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall and his people ſéeing they came againe ſo ſoone, and ſpecially ſéeing that they had neuer a lance, were come to yéelde themſelues to their mercie: but they ſoone knew that it was to begin againe the battaile. For although their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were vtterlie vnequal in number, ſpecially the Reiſters on the left ſide, being ſlipt away without doing ought, yet the reencounter was very furious and mortall to a great number of gallant men, In ſo much, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Duke of <hi>Guyſe</hi> the better to breake, or to ſlacke this furious diſmarch that the Admirall made vpon him, folowing his firſt point néere to the Mill againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> village of <hi>Maumontell,</hi> cauſed to come with all ſpeed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> French footemen, lead by the young Chunte <hi>de Briſſac,</hi> their Colonel in <hi>Piemont, Martigues</hi> and other, which yet could not be perceiued becauſe he had ſet them in battell behinde the horſemen, they being without pike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, were <hi>2000.</hi> harquebuziers, with the Spaniards, who all ſhooting inceſſantly againſt the Admirall, hurt manie horſes, and a number of the Confederates, thorough theyr ſo hot and ſo long a ſhowre of harque buſſe ſhot. Who yet could not let but that the horſemen of the Catholicke, were
<pb facs="tcp:15178:17"/>perced luſtelie by the Admirall with two hundred horſe, and by <hi>600.</hi> Reiſters in another quarter, and in the end were forced to recoile and giue place to blowes, and they had ben wholie broken if that the Harquebuſhes had not ſlacked the courſe of the horſes, and the furie of the Proteſtants, who hauing now changed their trot into a gallop, &amp; béeing cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed valiantlie to execute the charge, behaued their hands ſo well, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of all the horſemen on the ſide of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> there remained not with him vppon the place aboue foure ſcore or an hundreth, who in the end went to rallie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues by the helpe of their great bataillon of Frenchmen, who bare all the brunt, for the which it was well cheapned by the Admirall, who turned round about to finde a place of breach and ouerture, whereby he might doe ſome great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to the loſſe and euerthrow of the whole bodie of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie. But for lacke of lances, and becauſe the Admiral was not followed by all the Frenchmen, nor the Almans, they could neuer pearce them nor do other God, than deſtroie and endomage many of their troupes. The ſight had now endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red aboue fiue houres, and hardlie could one diſcerne the white ſcarfes which the Admiral and his ware, from the red of their enimies, when he cauſed his troupes to cloſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, putting y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Reiſters that he had left in two eſquadrons, and marching in the middeſt with the French horſemen, and commanding <hi>Bouchauanes</hi> the Lieuetenant of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Cornet, for to tarrie in the taile with about <hi>50.</hi> horſes. The Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> likewiſe rallied his men, &amp; ſéeing that the Admirall retired, aſſaied for to purſue him with all his footemen, as long as their breath wold ſerue them, and a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie few horſemen that were left about his perſon, but they had ſcarce gone ſeauen or eight hundred paces, but that the darkneſſe of the night did take awaie the ſight one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. So the Admirall retired a pace with thoſe footemen that were ſaued, the great artillerie, and all the baggage of the armie, a good league from the place of the Battaile to the village of <hi>Neufuille,</hi> where hée lodged. You ſée howe the Proteſtantes retyred from the place where they had
<pb facs="tcp:15178:18"/>attached their enimie, whom they left in the poſſeſſion ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, for to ſearch, ſpoile, and burne the dead, and to lift vp at leaſure the ſpoiled confederates. At the ſame time the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> went to lodge in the ſuburbes of <hi>Dreux,</hi> a little league from thence: the place of the battaile remaining voide, vnleſſe it were of them that were appointed for the effects before ſaid, &amp; a great number of dead men lying héere and there ſpoiled of all about them, and the Artillerie of the Conſtable, with foure field péeces of the Princes.</p>
               <p>Such was the end of the battaile of <hi>Dreux,</hi> in the which God balancing the victorie as it pleaſed him, made manie warriours to marke thrée notable occurrances, and verie rare in ſuch feats of armes. The firſt, that ther was no ſkir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh before the battaile: the ſecond, that both the Generals were taken priſoners: and thirdlie, that they rallied ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. As touching the dead, the Catholikes ſayd, after y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they had buried them, the next daie, that they found them to bée eight or nine thouſand. But other ſaid aſſuredlie, that there were dead on the place not aboue <hi>5000.</hi> without accounting the hurt men that died ſhortlie after, who were no ſmall number. At the reuiew which the Admiral made foure daies after, he found that there remained of the French footmen neere one thouſand of about <hi>2500.</hi> that had ben there, &amp; neere <hi>900.</hi> Almanes, of thrée thouſand that ſhould haue béene in their regiments: of whome about <hi>1400.</hi> (that had yéelded themſelurs priſoners in the chaſe that we ſpake of) were ſent home into their Countrie. Now of horſemen, to ſpeake the moſt, he found not miſſing aboue <hi>140.</hi> both of French &amp; Reiſters, not comprehending thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were taken priſoners. So that there died on the Prince his ſide but about <hi>2200.</hi> footmen. But on the Catholikes their part, the abatement of the Suiſſes was meruailous, of whom <hi>17.</hi> Captaines were ſlaine, their Colonell <hi>Freulich</hi> being dead before at <hi>Paris</hi> of a laſke. The reſt of the men ſlaine on that ſide were almoſt all horſemen, who were hardlie handled by the Reiſters as well at the taking of the Conſtable, as at the laſt charge: in the which among other, the Marſhall of Saint <hi>Andre,</hi> the
<pb facs="tcp:15178:18"/>Chieftaine of the auantgard hauing béene taken priſoner, and charged behinde by a Gentleman to get a great raun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome: <hi>Baubigny</hi> who had at another time taken at the heart a certaine diſpleaſure done by him, comming vpon him ſlew him, with a Piſtoll ſhot ouerthwart his head. Many other knights and Lordes were ſlaine there, as <hi>D'Annebault, D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Gemy</hi> with his <hi>Guidon,</hi> and the Marſhall of the <hi>Logis, la Broſſe,</hi> a great fauourite of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and a ſonne of his.</p>
               <p>It was a long time an opinion, both during &amp; after the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, that the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> was ſlaine. But ſome had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken his Eſquire from him, who was not much vnlike him in ſtature, &amp; whom the Duke had mounted on one of his beſt horſes, vpon whom he was ſlaine, euerie man taking him for his maiſter. <hi>Le Conte</hi> of <hi>Rochfort,</hi> called <hi>Damoiſel de Comeri,</hi> &amp; <hi>de Beauuois,</hi> &amp; <hi>Brichanteau</hi> were ſore hurt, <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uois</hi> died in the end, the reſt eſcaped. Saint <hi>Heran</hi> was ſaued by the meanes of one of the Princes Trumpetters, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was his Countriman, wherefore he was afterward in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be hanged. <hi>Pienne,</hi> whom we told you departed from <hi>Orleans,</hi> fell into the hands of <hi>la Loue,</hi> an honeſt &amp; valiant Gentleman, one of his olde friends. Who notwithſtanding rehearſing vnto him his fault, wold haue carried him away priſoner, but he could do and ſpeake wel, ſo aſſuring him at the laſt, that he ſhould ſoone die in his armes, he was ſo ſore hurt, that he let him goe, and <hi>Pienne</hi> recouered. <hi>D'aumalle</hi> was hurt, &amp; had one of his ſhoulder plate thruſt out of ioynt, whereof he remained long time hurt. <hi>Auſſon</hi> a gentleman of <hi>Gaſcogne</hi> ſo renowned in the parts of <hi>Piemont,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had made a Prouerbe of his hardineſſe, ran away with the firſt, euen to <hi>Chartes,</hi> where he died of an ague, that he tooke for griefe &amp; ſorrow: ſo much can the feare to léeſe reputation do in a gentlemanly heart. But the death of <hi>Frances</hi> of <hi>Cleues</hi> duke of <hi>Niuernois,</hi> gouernor of <hi>Champagne,</hi> the heire of the late <hi>Frances</hi> of <hi>Cleues</hi> his Father, is moſt remarkable, of all things that happened in this Battaile. This young Lorde béeing ſo wonne by <hi>Desbordes</hi> a Gentleman
<pb facs="tcp:15178:19"/>of <hi>Niuernos,</hi> by whome and by his Secretarie called <hi>Vige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naire,</hi> he let himſelfe be ſo wholie poſſeſſed, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that he had made profeſſion of the ſame religion that the Proteſtants did, and had twice promiſed the prince to come vnto him and follow him, yet he liked better to fight that daie for the Catholikes, whome he had before follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But it happened vpon the pricke of the firſt charge, that <hi>Desbordes</hi> himſelfe ill handling his Piſtoll, wounded the Duke in the thigh thrée fingers belowe the hanch, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the knee, ſo grieuouſlie, that there could be no meanes found to ſaue his life. And being ſo hurt, hée was carried as well as it could then be, vnto a village, and from thence to <hi>Dreux,</hi> paſſing vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the waie with fiue or ſix of his men, who carried him néere to <hi>Dandelot,</hi> who enquiring what he was, and hauing vnderſtood that it was the Duke of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers</hi> wounded to death, would not ſtaie him, but bidde him thinke vpon his faultes and offences. But as for <hi>Desbordes</hi> hée leauing his maiſter, did for deſpaire that he had ſlaine him, or for ſome other cauſe, runne ſo farre into the thickeſt of the enimies, that hée left his life in the place. But the poore Lord dyd ſore torment himſelf, but hee was ſomwhat comforted by <hi>Mouie,</hi> who onelie of all the Chieftaines of the Prince, had béene taken in the laſt charge, and hée ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing beene in his youth greatlie loued of the Duke of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers,</hi> ſerued him for a comforter, and as a miniſter, euen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he died. The principall priſoners beſides the Conſtable, was <hi>D'Oraiſon, De Rochfort, D'Eſclauoles,</hi> &amp; certain other Gentlemen. On the Princes part were ſlaine, the Baron of <hi>Arpaion, de Saux, de Chandien, de Liencourt, de Ligneris, de la Fredonniere, de la Carliere, de Rougnac de Mazelles,</hi> Saint <hi>Germier,</hi> almoſt all of them of the Cornet of <hi>Mouy,</hi> who was taken priſoner in the laſt charge, hauing ben hurt, and afterward tarrying long on foote in the wood adioyning. <hi>Throckmorton</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ambaſſador of <hi>England,</hi> &amp; <hi>Fances Perrucel</hi> the princes miniſter, thinking y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> all had been loſt, ſaued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> néere town of <hi>Nogeant,</hi> wher was the Dewager of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> the daughter of the great Seneſhall, who had
<pb facs="tcp:15178:19"/>giuen a taſt to the Prince the day before. And although they were deliuered priſoners to the Catholickes the next daye, yet <hi>Perrucel</hi> was afterward ſent to the Prince, to whom he ſerued well for to fortifie him, during the time of his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment. Alſo two other Miniſters were ſore hurt, but neither of them dyed: they were both gentlemen and bare armes. The one being Miniſter of <hi>Mouy</hi> his company, had ſcarſely made an ende of prayers going to the charge, but that he was ſtroken to the ground with the blow of a ſtone that hit him on the reines, and from thence after a thouſand ſtrange chaunces, carried to the next village, and afterward to <hi>Dreux,</hi> and finally to <hi>Paris,</hi> and was ſo well thought of among his enimies, without euer being knowen, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to doe any thing againſt his conſcience, that in the ende he came againe ſafe and ſound to <hi>Orleans.</hi> The other being brother of <hi>de la Cour de Chire,</hi> a learned gentleman of <hi>Poitou,</hi> had receaued an harquebuſſe ſhot in his reines, which carried a peece of his harneſſe into his bodie, and the bullet going to the other ſide euen to the ſkinne, néere to the nauell, was ſo well thought of, and holpen the euening after the battaile, that the péece of the harneſſe being taken out at the entrie of the wound, and the bullet at the ende, &amp; he being ſhut vp in the caſtell of <hi>Maintenon,</hi> was readie to take horſe againe within thrée wéekes.</p>
               <p>The newes of the battaile was ſoone brought by the run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awaies, both to <hi>Paris,</hi> and to <hi>Orleans,</hi> both the one and the other reporting that all was loſt on their ſide. The firſt that gaue the affright to <hi>Paris,</hi> was <hi>Guilaureau d' Orleans,</hi> folowed by many other, of whome ſome were good great ones, who all affirmed the ouerthrow of the battaile, and the taking of the Conſtable, as true it was, in ſo much that the partakers of the Catholickes ſtoode in no great ſure ſtate: when <hi>Loſſes</hi> ariued, reporting the taking of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall of the Proteſtants, and how the Duke of <hi>Guyſe</hi> had recouered all: adding alſo, that the Admiral was intierly defaited. Vpon the which report there were made at <hi>Paris,</hi> and in all other places, to whome theſe newes were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb facs="tcp:15178:20"/>with all diligence, all kinde of ioye, as bonefires, feaſts, dauncings, Maſkes, accompanied with Proceſſions, &amp; ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Bells, with all ioye and mirth On the other ſide the moſt ſpeedie to flie, made all things vncertaine at <hi>Orleans,</hi> but not quite deſperate, which helde all the people in ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe vntill the next day being the xx. of the moneth, when certaine newes came with them that brought the Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble priſoner, to whome they had giuen but a little refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the way after his taking, they making him march without once reſting all that night, and the day folowing, vntill he came to <hi>Orleans,</hi> and was put in the Princes lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging. He was not reſcued as he looked for, by <hi>100.</hi> light hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, &amp; eight companies of French men ouer whome <hi>Charry</hi> commaunded at <hi>Chartres,</hi> within ſight of whom they made him paſſe a pace. But for to come againe to the two armies, the Duke of <hi>Guyſe</hi> encamped néere <hi>Dreux,</hi> vſing all gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cioſitie towards the Prince: who alſo on his part ſhewed himſelfe nothing aſtonned, and ſo they paſſed the night, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſupped ſimply enough. In the morning the Duke who now remained ſole Chiefeteine of the armie, hauing cauſed halfe a ſcore or a doſen péeces of Ordenance to be ſhot of, for to aſſemble his people, made all the hurt men to be ſent into <hi>Dreux,</hi> and all the dead that could be found, to be buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Alſo the Enſignes that had bene wonne from the foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Prince, were brought vnto him, which he ſent afterward to <hi>Paris,</hi> in ſigne of victorie, becauſe the field was left vnto him. On the other ſide, the Admiral being at <hi>Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuille,</hi> &amp; hauing but ſlenderly reſted, &amp; giuen order to all that was poſſible, aſſembled all the Captains, aſwel Frenchmen as Reiſters, that he could, vnto whome, for to encourage them to an intiere &amp; aſſured victorie, he propoſed the hope of certaine victorie, if that at the very breake of the daye the next morning, they would charge their enimies, whome he knew were in great feare, hauing loſt their two principall Chiefeteines, and their horſemen being for the greateſt part ſlaine, and the reſt very much ſcatered, inſomuch, that they ſhould ſcarcely finde an hundreth horſes together, as
<pb facs="tcp:15178:20"/>he alſo learned by certaine ſouldiours priſoners, that had eſcaped, and came backe to the Campe laſt night. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto the Reiſters made aunſwere, that his counſell was verie couragious and good, but that it was impoſſible for them to execute it, many of their horſes being hurt, and the other tired, beſides that, many of their people were yet diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed, with a good part of their Wagons, the which they would not léeſe, and that they muſt néedes mend and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire their piſtolles. So by this meanes was that enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe broken of. Yet neuertheleſſe they went foorth the next day in battaile araie out of the village, and marched a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le way ouer againſt the quartier of the Catholickes, where he tarried about an houre, conſidering the countenaunce of his people, and for to reuoke as manie of his men as he could, that had bene ſcattered in the wood: and in the ende ſeeing himſelfe out of hope to be followed for to beginne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine the fight: drew directly to <hi>Gallardon,</hi> and the next day being the xxi. hauing left by the way one of his great peeces, to wit, a Couluerine, which was mired, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward waied vp, and carryed away by them of <hi>Chartres,</hi> he lodged at the village of <hi>Arneau,</hi> where he was choſen Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall of the armie in the abſence of the Prince. And from thence into <hi>Beauſſe,</hi> and <hi>Salogne,</hi> and from hence into <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandie,</hi> to méete with the Engliſh, winning many townes in thoſe parts.

And the ſpéede that he vſed in the march was ſo extréeme, that he made them trauaile on the way two dayes and a night without eating or drinking, but verie little, nor reſting but a verie ſhort time at <hi>Fontenay,</hi> and almoſt onely ſo long, as their baggage was in laying vp, being left there that they might march more ſpéedely and orderly. But before I doe goe any farther, I thinke it expedient to giue you a topographie, and
<pb facs="tcp:15178:21"/>deſcribe not onelie the place were the battaile was fought, but alſo the Countrie and the quarters néere aboutes, as well to repreſent vnto you more plainelie the moſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable perticulars of ſo famous a fight, as alſo for to make you vnderſtand the better that which I haue ſayde before of the fort of <hi>Luſon,</hi> and the waies of <hi>Poitou.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Catholikes then came from <hi>Fontenay</hi> ſtraight to Saint <hi>Gemme,</hi> from whence to <hi>Luſon</hi> is a good halfe league, and the fight was more néere to Saint <hi>Gemme:</hi> from thence going forth right, there are two tuffes of woode, to whome doe adioyne a great quarter of woode cut downe. Betwéene the two woodes are vines which doe continue and ſtretch, béeing ſeparated by hedges and great buſhes, euen almoſt to <hi>Luſon,</hi> both on the right and the lefte ſide, vnleſſe it bée in thrée or foure places, where bée certaine plaines laide out for the ſowing of Corne: as one comes from <hi>Fontenay</hi> to Saint <hi>Gemme,</hi> néere to <hi>Nalliers,</hi> the waie parteth it ſelfe into two, the one waie goeth ſtraight into <hi>Nalliers,</hi> and from thence to Saint <hi>Gemme,</hi> the other leaues <hi>Nalliers</hi> on the right hand, and after it hath cut croſſe ouer many quarters of vineyards, and many plaine fields, &amp; ſome marſhes, at the laſt it comes out againe into the great waie of S. <hi>Gemme</hi> vnto <hi>Luſon,</hi> whereof I will ſpeake vnto you anone: for by reaſon of it the Proteſtants did order their battaile other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than elſe they would haue done. <hi>Puygalliard</hi> that did not beléeue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſmal number of Proteſtants wold preſent themſelues vnto his old bands in a plaine, yet ſéeing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they were come forth, deuiſed how he might force them to a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall fight, &amp; for that intent, ſetting forward with his troupes with all ſpéede towards Saint <hi>Gemme,</hi> he ſent the Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and Albanoiſes for to kéepe the paſſage of <hi>Moreilles</hi> for to cut off their waie of returne, and alſo cauſed very ſubtilly a bruite to run therof, that he might bring the Proteſtants in deſpaire of returne to <hi>Rochel:</hi> for they had none other way but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, except another y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> leads fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Marans</hi> to <hi>Luſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> which was verie ill and bad, by reaſon of the waters, &amp; the mirie marſhes which lie betwéene them, where the horſes would

And to make you knowe more certainlie all thinges that paſſed in this occurrence, I will tell you the meanes that he vſed to aſſemble his troupes, his march on the waie, and his conduct.</p>
               <p>He hauing appointed the <hi>Rende-uos</hi> or place where all his troups ſhould méet at <hi>Fontenay,</hi> he did ſet them on their waie, &amp; with ſixe horſes he came thether himſelf about mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle night of the day before the battaile. When he was come, he cauſed a bruite to be noiſed abrode y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> he had gotten an hot ague, the which made him to kéep his bed verie ſick: &amp; he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed many to ſée him in bed, to the end y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the newes might go the ſooner to the eares of the Proteſtants, and make them therfore careleſſe to kéepe themſelues vpon their gards, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſo he might more eaſilie break them by a ſurpriſe, rather than by the hazard of an entire battaile. And y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he might not faile in his deuiſe, he commanded the Maire of <hi>Fontenay</hi> to ſend vnto them a Trumpetter, who aſſuring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his ſickneſſe, might bring him word of the eſtate of their gards, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber &amp; reſolution of their forces, vnder coulour of dealing for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance of <hi>Rouſsiere,</hi> &amp; other priſoners, that they held in S. <hi>Gemme.</hi> In the meane while his companies by litle &amp; litle ariued at <hi>Fontenay,</hi> not without great paines, &amp; diſpleaſure both for the length of the waie, &amp; alſo the trouble y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the night brought them, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were to paſſe in ſuch long marches, &amp; becauſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> no man ſhould be ſuffered to ſtay in the town for to bait, or to reſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, or to do any other thing than leaue there their baggage: the Maire cauſed a number of pipes of wine, &amp; certaine bread to be ſet forth in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtréets for the ſouldiers to take as they paſſed along. In ſum, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he might ſpéed &amp; aſſure his enterpriſe, he would giue them no more time for to tarrie, than leaſure for to make awaie that diſtribution. But the companies came thether ſo by péece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mele,
<pb facs="tcp:15178:22"/>ſo wearie &amp; ſo tired with the long iourney, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he could not let them, but that the ſouldiers woulde néedes lodge there, ſome to reſt both their bodie &amp; ſpirit, that ſleeped as they marched, ſome for to bait &amp; get them new ſtrength, that they might be better able to accompliſh the commandement of their Generall, who being forced to pleaſe the ſouldiers, &amp; iudging that he ſhould be able to get them from their reſt at the leaſt foure houres before night, commanded y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Maire &amp; certaine of the inhabitants, who might happelie make <hi>15.</hi> horſes, for to beat y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> waies, &amp; to learne newes, &amp; to bring him certaine word of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enimie, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had heard no certaintie <hi>3.</hi> daies before: aſſuring them that he would be at <hi>Mozeuil</hi> (two leagues from Saint <hi>Gemme</hi>) with all his armie by Sun ſet. The ſcouts gaue in as far as (<hi>heuretes,</hi> a league of Saint <hi>Gemme,</hi> &amp; ſent ſome to tell him, that <hi>Puuiant</hi> and the greateſt part of the <hi>Poiteuins</hi> were at Saint <hi>Gemme,</hi> doubting nothing of him. But becauſe the ſouldiers mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched not reſolutelie, he was when he receiued this newes but halfe a league fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Fontenay,</hi> which is diſtant <hi>4.</hi> leagues from S. <hi>Gemme,</hi> &amp; as much from <hi>Luſon</hi>) ranging his troups in battaile néere to <hi>Longeſue.</hi> In like manner <hi>Puuiant</hi> had ſent forth a number of horſe for to diſcouer the plaine, &amp; to haue certaine aduiſe of the deſſeines of <hi>Puigaillard,</hi> of whoſe fained ſickneſſe he had ben aduertiſed by the Trumpetter, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I told you of before, whom <hi>Puuiant</hi> (ſuſpecting by his ſpeech &amp; countenance, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was come to eſpie the eſtate of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants) had beaten ſo long, vntill he diſcouered all that had bene done, and thervpon he ſent his people into the plaine, vpon whoſe diſcouerie the Maire of <hi>Fontenay</hi> retired him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.

<pb facs="tcp:15178:23"/>at <hi>Mozeuil,</hi> the darkneſſe whereof hauing made them léeſe the ſight and light of the waies, where they ſhould go: with in ſhort time the greateſt part of them ſcattered, béeing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded héere and there whether the vncertaintie of the paths lead them, yea, thoſe that knew the waie beſt could not tell which waie to take. At that inſtant the Enſignes and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, found themſelues ſo forſaken of their ſcattered ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and there happened thereby ſuch confuſion among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that the formoſt auantcourers found themſelues néere to them that were formoſt, to make the taile. But on the other ſide the courers of the Proteſtants béeing returned to Saint <hi>Gemme,</hi> to make reporte of the Catholike beaters of the waies that they had diſcouered, were the occaſion that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Gentlemen (that well knew the waies of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie) mounted on horſebacke, to bring more certaine aduice, and they had not rode long, but that they heard the greate noiſe of the ſcattered troupes, that hallowed and called one vnto another, for to bée ſet into the waie: and riding yet a little farther, to be more throughlie informed of all that was done, they lighted at the laſt vpon ſeauen or eight of the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, ſome on foote, &amp; ſome on horſebacke, marching as men aſſured, becauſe they were perſwaded that about <hi>500.</hi> of their auantcourers were before them, which was the cauſe, that when they were aſked whether goe you? They anſwered amiablie, <hi>Amy, Amy,</hi> Friend, Friend: marching ſtill without putting themſelues in defence, eſtéeming them for their owne people. But being aſtonied by thrée Piſtoll ſhot that was giuen them for a good night, they refuſed not to mount behinde the Proteſtants, who carried them to <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiant,</hi> to whom they declared their intent and purpoſe, &amp; the néere approch of the troups. Preſentlie the alarme runneth throughout the Borough of Saint <hi>Gemme:</hi> the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets (all the men hauing vppon the aduertiſements of the firſt ſcoutes armed themſelues and ſaddled their horſes) and being readie to march, néeded to do no more but ſound to the ſtandard &amp; ſet forward. For at that inſtant they diſlod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, for to aduertiſe <hi>la Noue</hi> that abode at <hi>Luſon,</hi> of all that
<pb facs="tcp:15178:23"/>we haue folde you before, and to exhibite into conſultation of the counſail, what was to be reſolued vpon in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The which <hi>la Noue</hi> dyd alſo ſoone doe, as well for to ſound the hearts of his, as alſo not to miſſe, but with the opinion of them all, if that fortune ſhould make their firſt deſſe in fall out ill.</p>
               <p>The opinions were diuers, and the aſſembly was diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into two aduiſes, as it doth ordinarely happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſuch importance, namely among y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Chiefeteines, that would manage their affaires conſiderately, and rather by the common aduice, then their own particular motion. The chiefe Captaines being aſſembled, <hi>la Noue</hi> did declare vnto them, the enterpriſe that they had made againſt the Fort, and the occaſion thereof, that now it was come to this point that they could not longer abide before the place, but that they muſt either fight, or elſe retire them ſelues. As tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the firſt, the armie of the enimie is great, well furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed both for men, and equipage, and a third mo in number then the Proteſtants. But that which is more to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in this occurrence is, that although we doe obtaine the victorie, yet we ſhall thereby not aduaunce at all the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of the publicke, and the totall cauſe, if that fortune fall out ill to our great armie, vnder the conduct of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall, which euery day is in doings with the Marſhall of <hi>Coſſe,</hi> and vppon the point to darreyne battaile with the kings forces: for then ſhall this victorie of ours, be rather lamentable, then profitable. For as it can not be obtained but with great effuſion of bloud, and the death of manie braue Captaines and valiant ſouldiours: ſo that if the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie of the Princes be broken, thoſe that ſhall dye in this fight now at hand, will ſo leſſen our forces, that we ſhall not be able to maintaine <hi>Rochell</hi> againſt the Catholickes, who may ſoone repaire and leuie an other armie: becauſe they doe ſwarme in people vnder the auctoritie that they haue ſtolen from the king. But, ſéeing that he remitted the reſolution of the one and the other vnto the pluralitie of voices, thoſe that maintained the fight, carried it away in
<pb facs="tcp:15178:24"/>number. Beſides the diſhonor (ſayde they) that the armie ſhall gette by ſuch a retraite, it can not be done but with an other greater loſſe of men, then ſhall be ſpent in the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile: namely, ſéeing that the Catholickes march vpon them with ſo great ſpéede. Adde therevnto, that the Italians (as they thought) had ſette foorth for to cut of the way for none other conſideration, but to impeach them of all wayes of retires. Wherevpon <hi>Puuiant,</hi> tooke the word out of their mouthes, and of a particular motion ſayd aloud: So that wée doe goe reſolutely to the charge, the victorie is certainly ours, for they are all ſo werie, ſo couered ouer with duſt, by reaſon of the long iourney that they haue made, and beſides they are ſo charged with ſléepe, that they will not be able to ſuſtaine the firſt charge of our people. As touching the reſt, God, who is as great, as ſtrong, and as well willed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his, as euer he was, hath prouided for farre greater inconueniences than thoſe that can befall to vs, if our great armie hap to be broken. If in all occaſions that are preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to men, man ſhew himſelfe noble and couragious, God will ſupply, the reſt, and furniſh vp the imperfection of man, of whome he demaunds no more, but his deuoire. Let vs then doe that lieth in vs, &amp; he that hath guided vs herevnto for to maintaine his cauſe, will of his almightie power, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh that, which our feeble power lacketh. The auctori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and no leſſe the good fortune, that accuſtometh to fauour ſuch a Chiefeteine, was of ſo great force with the reſt of that troupe that <hi>la Noue</hi> had no ſooner aſked them all whether they were reſolued to fight, but that their long acclamatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; laughing countenances, aſſured him of the good will that they had to doe it. In ſo much that hauing admoniſhed them not diſcharge before they were néere their enimie, to purſue their poinct furiouſly, &amp; to recharge without ceaſe, as long as they ſhould ſée any number of their enimies in troupe, for feare, leaſt they ſhould rallie after they were broken: gaue commaundement to euery Captaine for to goe &amp; order and encourage his troupes, and that the Miniſters ſhould preſently preach vnto euerie companie, praying God to ſend
<pb facs="tcp:15178:24"/>them an happie ſucceſſe in this battaile, ſo daungerous as euerie man is more religious when he ſées him ſelfe preſſed néere to any ill, but if all things laught vpon him at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, then our nature is to forget him quickly, to whom we were ſo deuout whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we feared y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> baſtonnades of a miſchief néere at hand. But I will leaue them at their prayers, and preparing of themſelues to the reencounter, the which they held aſſured, and bring <hi>Puigaillard</hi> forward, who ſtaying for nothing leſſe then for feare of raiſing of <hi>Puuiant</hi> and his companions out of their beddes, haſted amaine. But he was ſcarſe at <hi>Cheurettes,</hi> but that the companies of the Kings gard, who being the ſpéedieſt, had made a ſtand for a certeine tyme, ſtaying for the reſt, gaue ſoone enough in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the barries of Sainct <hi>Gemme,</hi> (for the Proteſtants had ſhutte vppe the wayes of Sainct <hi>Gemme,</hi> and <hi>Luſon</hi>) which they gotte, and paſſed without reſiſtaunce, and ran thorough the borough, in the houſes whereof, they founde the beddes yet hot, wherewithall they finding themſelues grieued, did whileſt they ſtayed for the armie, ſome of them lay them downe to ſléepe, other fell to filling of their bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and ſome ranne to haſten <hi>Puigaillard,</hi> and to carrie him the newes of taking of Sainct <hi>Gemme:</hi> whereinto he entred before the pricke of the daye, crying in all quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to his Souldiours to come out of the houſes, to putte them in order, and range of Battaile, for to folow the Proteſtants, who, ſome ſayde, were fledde to <hi>Marans,</hi> and from thence to paſſe to <hi>Beraud.</hi> In the ende, ſéeing that the moſt part of the companies were out of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, he made them turne headde directly to <hi>Luſon,</hi> wher he hoped to be reuenged of the occaſion that had hadde ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped out of his hande.</p>
               <p>There fiftie ſouldiours Auantcourers (of the beſt mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the Kings garde) whome he had ſent before the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, ſent him woord, that they had diſcouered the enimie, who was prettie néere, and in battaile. Theſe were a nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of Gentlemen of the countrie, who going out of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> for to deuaunce the Armie, hadde giuen in as farre
<pb facs="tcp:15178:25"/>as the tuffes of wood (which were before marked vnto you) being determined to trie the aſſurance and reſolution of the Catholickes by ſome notable ſkirmiſh, the which yet paſſed lightly enough, as well on the one ſide as the other. Vpon this certaine of the Catholicke armie being returning, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encountred x. or twelue valets of the Proteſtants, that led <hi>Rouſsiere</hi> priſoner, whome they recouered, and ſent him to <hi>Puygaillard,</hi> who was ſo ioyfull thereof, that this incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him more to haſten his companies for to folow the luck of ſo good a beginning. And vpon this, making all his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to aſſemble vnder their Enſignes, he placed in the front one of the companies of the kings gard to ſerue for <hi>Enfans perdus,</hi> to ſkirmiſh with the formoſt of the Proteſtants, vnder the fauour of the hedges, and buſhes, that I haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed vnto you before. As the footemen ranged themſelues to march in battaile, the horſemen came péece by péece, and man after man, to be at the medley: whome he deuided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two hedges within a fielde néere to the vale of <hi>Erant,</hi> directly lying betwéene Saint <hi>Gemme</hi> and <hi>Luſon.</hi> But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward ſéeing that from that place he diſcouered not his enimie enough, he made them paſſe on the left hand of the way, for to enter into a Viniard, which ſtoode almoſt ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right directly againſt that valley, where the footemen hadde encamped themſelues. But by reaſon of the diches that they muſt needes paſſe, (with whome I haue alreadie tolde you, the moſt part of the way is encloſed, to kéepe thoſe that paſſe by, that they come not into the Vines) they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to make their horſes leape ouer the dike, one after an other, and in like order afterward to put themſelues in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile as they ariued one after an other in a row, at the place appointed, the which the horſemen of the Proteſtants, who were alreadie in battaile marked: and ſéeing the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes as it were to riſe out of the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d before them, would not giue leaſure to aboue ſixe or ſeuen ſcore horſes to take range of battaile, and to put themſelues in eſtate of defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, but that they charged them before they were all aſſembled, and in aray for the reencounter: while in the meane time
<pb facs="tcp:15178:25"/>the footemen of the Catholikes, ranged themſelues alſo by little and little vnder their Enſignes towards the vally <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raut,</hi> where I doe praie you leaue them all to take range of battaile, that you may ſée the diſpoſition that in the meane time, the Proteſtants gaue to all their companies for to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine the aſſaile of <hi>Puygaillard,</hi> or according to occaſion to charge to their aduantage. The dawning of the daie appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, beganne to chaſe awaie the thicke darkneſſe of the night, when the ſcoutes of <hi>Puuiant</hi> aduertiſed <hi>la Noue,</hi> that <hi>Puygaillard</hi> not willing to reſt at Saint <hi>Gemme,</hi> made his footemen to march forward a great pace on the lefte hand, and his horſemen directlie to <hi>Luſon,</hi> and that he heard the noiſe of the formoſt that marched in battaile without the Borough: which was the occaſion that he ſet <hi>Puuiant</hi> in the front with fortie horſes, and before him <hi>la Roch</hi> with fiftéene or ſixtéene horſemen, and yet farther before Saint <hi>Eſtienne</hi> with thirtie helmet men and certaine Harquebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziers, leauing at his backe twentie horſemen, that <hi>Bruncli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ere</hi> lead. Afterward he ordered the reſt of the armie at lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. The footmen whereof were quicklie ranged in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, vnder the charge of their Colonell <hi>Payet,</hi> at the foure wayes of the Mill <hi>Chapitre,</hi> flanked by the troupe of <hi>Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize,</hi> to whoſe ſide <hi>la Noue</hi> ſent thoſe horſemen that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe woulde leade. Héere was the groſſe of the armie which <hi>la Noue</hi> cauſed to encampe in that place, as well to ſupplie the neceſſitie of ſuccour that <hi>Puuiant</hi> might craue as for to couer and hide the plaie, and to kéepe the beſieged ſtronglie in breath, to the end that hée might take from them the knowledge of the armie that <hi>Puygaillard</hi> hadde brought, and conſequentlie to impeach them from iſſuing out vppon the taile of the Proteſtants, whileſt they fought with other Catholikes in front (as <hi>Hambal</hi> dyd a <hi>Teſin</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>P. Scipio,</hi> whome hée put to flight, by reaſon that he had ſent certaine <hi>Numidians</hi> to charge him in the taile du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the battaile.) And without doubt all things ſéemed to laugh on <hi>Puygaillard,</hi> if that fortune had not ouerthwarted
<pb facs="tcp:15178:26"/>the courſe of his deſſeines, for he ſhould neuer haue put him ſelfe betwéene two enimies, although the Proteſtants were few. Sée what hapned to the <hi>Fidenates,</hi> that had put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues betwéene <hi>Mamercus Aemilius</hi> the Dictator, &amp; <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> his Lieuetenant, for they were wholie broken. Lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>Aluian,</hi> the Generall of the Piſans was vnhappie, becauſe hée béeing aſſailed at Saint <hi>Vincent</hi> by <hi>Bentiuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gli</hi> the Generall of the Florentines on the Front, on the ſide, and behinde, ſawe all his whole armie defaited. Theſe troupes were not ſo ſoone ſet in araie, but that the <hi>Enfans Perdus</hi> aduanced in two bands (without the bodie of the foot men) in number of <hi>100.</hi> or <hi>120.</hi> harquebuziers lead by the Captaines, <hi>Normand,</hi> &amp; <hi>la Garde,</hi> had the ſignall to charge, almoſt at the verie ſame time that <hi>Puuiant</hi> and Saint <hi>Eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enne</hi> were at the charge.</p>
               <p>Now ſée the forme of the battaile. <hi>Puuiant</hi> who lead the greateſt part of the forces of <hi>Poitou,</hi> had diſtributed all his troupes in forme of an hedge, by reaſon of the ſmall number of his men. Moreouer, his troupes did not follow one another ſtraight, but as it were bias, to the ende that all his troupes might bée ſéene within the waie of <hi>Fonte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay,</hi> fearing that <hi>Puygaillard</hi> woulde cauſe ſome of his troupes to march along that ſide to giue them the flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quado. In the meane time <hi>Puygaillard</hi> ſet his men in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raie, and made the more haſt becauſe it was tolde him that the Proteſtants came to ſéeke him. I haue tolde you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that betwixt Saint <hi>Gemme</hi> and <hi>Luſon,</hi> there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Vines encloſed with hedges and thicke buſhes, and certaine large plots of plaine ground, which are ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the waie, the which is ſtraight and forth right, and of a good largeneſſe, and flanked on both ſides with like defences.</p>
               <p>Hauing ſet one front of <hi>Enfans perdus</hi> behinde thoſe hedges, and in certaine ditches and chanells that are there, and namelie behinde the buſhes of certaine vines, ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted one from another by a plaine field, the which is leuell
<pb facs="tcp:15178:26"/>inough: hée made one regiment to aduance into the valley <hi>Eraut,</hi> and ſet the reſt of the footemen more on the left hand of Saint <hi>Gemme,</hi> hée would haue flanked them with horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, but he had no leaſure to doe it, as I will tell you. You haue ſéene the deſſeines, the number, the iourney, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and diſpoſition of the two armies for to fight: now it reſteth for you to beholde what was the charge, the medlie, the purſuite, and the flight of the leſſe happie, and how the victorious followed their good houre. I ſent Saint <hi>Eſtienne</hi> (otherwiſe called young <hi>Violle-uigne</hi>) followed by their hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met men, to the front of the Proteſtants armie. As ſoone as he ſawe the Catholikes range themſelues in battaile one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another in a rowe, he aduertiſed <hi>la Noue:</hi> who rightlie preſuming, that if <hi>Puigaillard</hi> had time and leaſure to order all his troupes, that he might carie awaie the honour of this battaile, gaue the word of S. <hi>Eſtienne,</hi> and commanded him to go reſolutelie to the charge, &amp; to follow his point, as long as he ſawe himſelfe accompanied by anie of his fellowes. At the ſame inſtant he ordeined <hi>Puuiant</hi> to ſuſtaine him, if hée ſawe him weake, and to ſecond his good houre if he ſawe the firſt charge to beare it ſelfe as he hoped: then he abode himſelf lower, with all the reſt for to ſuccour al occurrances. At that verie preſent, Saint <hi>Eſtienne</hi> diſmarched in view of all the Catholikes, who would not ſet forward when they were ſo far of, but ſuffered them to come within fiftie paces of them, yea, &amp; till they ſaw them change their pace to a trot, that they might take a gallop for to charge them: the <hi>25.</hi> or <hi>30.</hi> helmet men of <hi>Malicornes</hi> companie of men of armes, whome <hi>D' Heruilliers</hi> lead, diſbanded themſelues out of the troupe, and haſting their pace, receiued them after ſuch a faſhion, that if the other that mooued not, had ſeconded them as cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiouſlie, they had gotten more honour that daie. But the confederates, who as aſſailants went reſolutely to the charge, turning otherwiſe to their aduauntage, the ſmall account that the Catholikes made to remoue themſelues, pearced ſo luſtelie, and with ſuch purſuite all that they reencountered, that after the death and wounding of ſome, the companie
<pb facs="tcp:15178:27"/>of <hi>D' Heruilliers</hi> found themſelues not ſufficient to ſuſtaints them. But being returned to the bodie of the horſemen, who now ſetting forth made a good number of them, without the remonſtrances of <hi>Puigaillard,</hi> (who tooke all paine for to encourage and to aduance them to the defait of them, that for the ſhocke receiued of <hi>D' Heruilliers,</hi> were halfe ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and readie to turne face if they were liuelie purſued) to march: When the two troupes of <hi>Puuiant</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented themſelues on the lefte ſide, as though they woulde haue charged them on that ſide. But ſéeing that the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes came not forward at all like men reſolute to fight: as ſoone as they hadde receiued thoſe that reſted whole of the Cornet of Saint <hi>Eſtienne,</hi> they turned vpon the right hand and charged them ſo furiouſlie, that not one of them had the heart to ſuſtaine them, but all tourned their faces thether from whence they came. The worſt was, that they béeing hotlie purſued, had no pittie, and leſſe feare to breake the companies of their footemen, that came at their backes, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcarce yet all in battaile araie, thorugh whom they paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſo ſpéedelie, that the footemen felt their harme as ſoone as they had diſcouered their flight. In ſumme, their ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine departure out of the field of the battaile, did ſo diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage all the reſt of the horſemen, by reaſon of the aſſurance that they had in the formoſt, and fartheſt aduaunced, with whome the Generall thought to arme the front of his horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that all the wordes, threates, and remonſtraunces of <hi>Puygaillard,</hi> who thought to ſtaie them for to rallie them for the defence, if not of their honour, alreadie halfe loſt, yet at the leaſt of the footemen, whome they lefte to the bout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie, profited him nothing, but was at laſt conſtrained himſelfe, béeing lefte alone, and ſo neere his enimies, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe that long and large waie which the beſt mounted had traced vnto him. <hi>Puuiant</hi> and many other purſued ſome ſo néere, that thoſe which were worſe mounted were leſſe happie, and firſt vrged to yéelde their life.</p>
               <p>Inſomuch that the moſt parte béeing (as of the Ordinaunces, paſſing well mounted, the pourſuite
<pb facs="tcp:15178:27"/>profitted them nothing, and they retired themſelues with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Fontenay,</hi> which was with foure leagues, where <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igaillard</hi> ariued about noone, and yet the retrait could not be neere enough for them, that thought themſelues ouer hotly purſued. King <hi>Antigonus</hi> ſéeing himſelfe mocked for flying away, with the fewe that were left him: I fled not (aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered he) but I purſued the profit that I ſawe behinde mée. So the Catholickes ranne to <hi>Fontenay,</hi> for to finde there a neadeful commodie to ſaue their liues. I haue tould you alreadie that the field wherein the horſemen of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholickes began to range themſelues, had but one entrie, flanked on both ſides with Vines, fenſed with high buſhes, betweene whome they muſt paſſe to charge the Catholicks, theſe buſhes couered a great number of haquebuziers, who ſhot at Saint <hi>Eſtienne:</hi> but they could not ſtaye aboue thrée or foure, but the reſt of the horſes furniſhed their carriere, and carryed their men (ſome of whome were hurte) euen to the charge. <hi>Granzay</hi> (the youngeſt of the <hi>Bogifiere Courterne le Re,</hi> and <hi>la Roche du Gue,</hi> tarryed there. <hi>Chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelandiere</hi> the Enſigne of Saint <hi>Eſtienne,</hi> and fiue or ſixe other, although they were hurt, yet went forward, but being ſuſteined by <hi>Malicornes</hi> men, they were ſo hurt, that they could liue no longer then the next day.</p>
               <p>Now touching the <hi>Enfans perdus,</hi> they marched ſo cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiouſly one againſt the other, as though they would not fight but onely with their ſwords, wherefore they appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched ſo neere together, that all of them cryed away har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuzades. Then the Captaines with their ſwords and targets, &amp; the ſouldiours recharged as ſpéedely, as the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of warres would permit them, ſending freſh ſuccours where néede required, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eming as though they would haue continued that play a long time. But the Catholickes ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing heard the piteous crye of them, whome their horſemen flying, had broken, dyd not ſo ſoone know that the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants folowed their victorie (the which they pereeued by the long cryes and ioyfull acclamations of their enimies) but that they began to tremble and ſhrinke backe in the
<pb facs="tcp:15178:28"/>meane time that their companions dyd their deuoire to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelues vnder the auantage of the hedges &amp; buſhes that couered them. But yet in the ende, ſéeing the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants approch and ſtil come vpon them thorough the vines, they forſooke their buſhes, for to caſt themſelues into the plaine, where the reſt of their fellowes had rallied with other, and encouraged themſelues for a certaine time for to ſuſteine their enimies. But when the Proteſtants were ſeaſed of the buſhes, behinde whome they ſhot at their eaſe without euer miſſing that great regiment, they with many horſemen, crying victorie, caſt themſelues among them, as on a loſt bodie, for to ouerthrow them intierely: ſo that they were in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ende conſtrained ſome to flye, other to put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to the mercie of the ſword, or the pitie of the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious. And to ſay the trueth, if it had not bene for <hi>la Noue,</hi> very few had eſcaped the furie of the Proteſtant, namelie, of the Lanſquenet who came to the defait. Theſe ſouldiers doing the worſt they could vppon theſe olde hands, for to ſhew that they would be reuenged of the ill happe, that had fell vpon them at <hi>Moncoutour,</hi> ſpake nothing elſe but <hi>deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cot Chelme Moncoutour,</hi> villaine doeſt thou not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <hi>Moncoutour,</hi> vnto thoſe that being diſarmed, could not defend themſelues, much leſſe aunſwere to their outragious ſpeach. And except their Colonell, who contenting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with pillage, had appeaſed his wrath, they were all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined not to returne into their Countrie, but well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged for their companions, that had bene ſo well feaſted. This battaile made many Catholickes and Proteſtants note and marke, as afterward ſome of them dyd often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that as footemen are at this day furniſhed and conduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they muſt not fight in the plaine againſt horſemen, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they be flanked or ſuſtained by horſemen: ſéeing that the very Suiſſes who kéepe their rankes beſt, and reſt moſt aſſured to rallie, in caſe they be broken, wil no more march, vnleſſe they be flanked, with French Harquebuziers and horſemen, namely againſt the French horſemen.</p>
               <p>Sée what happened to <hi>P. Valerius</hi> and <hi>L. Aemilius,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb facs="tcp:15178:28"/>the <hi>Voſces</hi> and <hi>Latines,</hi> who had ouerthrowen their footemen, if their horſemen had not come to their ſuccour. And what of our blacke bands before <hi>Naples,</hi> who being incited by to much hardineſſe, as they which had paſſed wel before, were ſo ill entreated by the <hi>Neapolitan</hi> horſemen, becauſe they had no horſemen to ſuſteine them, that their braue enterpriſe was bpoken: as were the Suiſſes by the Proteſtants at the battaile of <hi>Dreux,</hi> and by king <hi>Frances</hi> at the battaile of Saint <hi>Brigide</hi> néere <hi>Marignan,</hi> vpon the <hi>Milaneſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The footemen in generall, were endebted and bound to la <hi>Noue</hi> and <hi>Soubize,</hi> who cauſed the boucherie of the Frenchmen to ceaſe, they yéelding to haue their liues ſaued, except one Captaine Enſigne Colonell, who preferring death before diſhonor, the which he thought he ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue by ſuruiuing ſo many valiant ſouldiours ſlaine, wold not abandon one ſo honorable a péece of ſilke, but with the loſſe of his life. And doubtleſſe, the ſuretie and ſauing of an Enſigne is of ſuch conſequence, that any good ſouldiour will neuer omit to doe his deuoire to kéepe it for any dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that ſhall be preſented him: in ſo much that he will reſolue to fight vnder the ſhadow of his Enſigne, euen to the laſt breath of his lyfe. Sixtéene Enſignes, and two Cornettes were taken, and about <hi>500.</hi> ſlaine, and <hi>700.</hi> or <hi>800.</hi> priſoners ſent away with a white rodde in their hand. Many Captains died there, as <hi>Marguarin</hi> &amp; other, but all ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Liuetenants or Enſignebearers: for ther were not one but <hi>la Hiliere,</hi> a Captaine in chiefe of a companie of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment Reall. Of horſemen leſſe then thirtie dyed, for they ſaued themſelues by flight. Vpon a ſodaine the victorious preſented their Enſignes before the Fort, which yéelded, the foure Enſignes, whereof made vp the number of two and twentie, brought to <hi>Rochel.</hi> And becauſe that <hi>Maſcaron</hi> complained of <hi>la Noue,</hi> for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> contrarie to the promiſe of aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red compoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he had certain baggage taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, which had ben permitted him to carry away, <hi>la Noue</hi> tooke <hi>400.</hi> crowns of a priſoner, which he cauſed to be caried to him, to
<pb facs="tcp:15178:29"/>content him, and to maintaine his promiſe. But the carier being ſlaine at the taking of the Miniſter <hi>de Chire</hi> at <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeuill,</hi> as I will tell you in an other place, the money was not deliuered vnto him. But to returne backe againe to our battaile: the diſmiſſed ſouldiours retired, attributing the occaſion of all the ill hap vnto the ouer hot haſt of <hi>Pui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gallard,</hi> and for that it was accompanied as ſome ſay, with a contemning of the Proteſtants. In déede he little practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the example of <hi>Paulus Aemylius,</hi> the Conſull and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall of the Romans, who trauailing with an armie tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough Macedonie, againſt <hi>Perſeus</hi> the king of the Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, had marched almoſt all one whole day a great pace, for to ioyne with the enimie, and to come to fight the which was preſented vnto him. But although his people made countenance of accepting of the good offerre, &amp; cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues that he ſhould leade them to the enimie: yet neuer the leſſe becauſe be ſaw the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wery, by reaſon they had mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched preatie long with their bagage on their back, all bathed in ſweat, lilling their tongue half a foot out of their mouth, for extreeme thirſt, that tormented them, their eyes, mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes and faces full of duſt, and burnt vp, and halfe roaſted with the ſcorching heate of midday, he would not preſent them to the battaile, nor bring them in ſight of a freſh and aranged enimie, ſeeing that for lack of ſtrength many reſted and ſtayed themſelues vppon their bucklers and iauelins, ſticked in the ground, for to hold them vp: but contrarie to the opinion of many, commaunded the formoſt bands to lay downe their burdens, and baggage that they carryed, and meaſure out the front of a Romane campe. (They were not ſo delicate as our bands be, for the meaneſt of whome a doſen of baggage carriers, and ſo many gouiats or drud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges after them be not ſufficient) And when <hi>Publicus Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſica,</hi> one of the beſt qualited gentlemen in the army, tould him, that it were better to purſue the enimie, who vnto that day had alwaies fledde before them, then to leaue him one night frée for the flie longer, and to renew the paine of the Romans in ſéeking him farther: he aunſwered modeſtlie
<pb facs="tcp:15178:29"/>without ſhewing of himſelfe anie whit altered for that bold aduertiſement: I haue had héeretofore the minde that you haue now <hi>Naſica,</hi> and you will one daie haue that which I haue now. Many &amp; diuerſe accidents of warre haue taught mée to know the time when to fight, and when to refuſe. But ſéeing that leaſure is denied mée to ſaie anie more, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent your ſelfe for this time with the authoritie of an olde Captaine: neuer contemne your enimie more than you haue had good occaſion. One ought alſo to conſider the commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the place, the circumſtance of time, the qualitie of the furniture, the number of men of warre, the forme, the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the fight, the good heart and hardineſſe of his men, the obedience of his ſouldiers, the authoritie and braue reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Generall, which both ſerue oftentimes to bring to a good end an exploit wel conceiued. But ſo it is, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies fortune doth ſaie and ſing aloud, and cléere, that all is hers, and ſhe doth plaie in enterpriſes of warre as fréelie as the fiſh doth in the great and wide Ocean. But of all other the olde bands that ſerued <hi>Puigaillard,</hi> as the beſt footemen of this age, did take verie impatientlie to bée ſpoiled of their weapons. What (ſaid one) after that I haue done notable ſeruice to my king for the ſpace of fifteene yéeres together, ſhal I ſuffer ſuch diſhonour? And ſhal I after twentie yeres, and I after thirtie, and I after fortie, ſayd another, beare the ſcorne of a ſouldier diſgraded? Good fellowe, for Gods ſake leaue me (ſayde they) but my harquebuſſe, but my pike, but my ſword, take all euen to my ſhirt, that the face of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie may not ſée me in the habite of a gouiat and drudge. But the Souldiers victorious growing in deſpite, becauſe they could not take from them their liues for the counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund of their Generall, ſtopped their eares againſt ſuch praters. The which one of the Captaines, an Enſigne Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell perceiuing, for to ſhew in what honour wee ought to holde the Armies and degrees that haue béen given vs, and alſo what difference there is betweene a chiefe of marke, and a ſimple Souldier, loued better to die with honour, couered and wrapped in his Enſigne, than to
<pb facs="tcp:15178:30"/>drinke of ſuch ſhame. So before theſe braue chiefe died, hée patientlie ſawe the purple of his bloud die the white Taffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas of his Enſigne Crimſon. I doe remember me of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne Colonell of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> that bare the Eagle Imperiall in the ciuile warres. This Romane Captaine knowing what ſhame it is to leaue the Enſigne to bée wonne by the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, when he ſawe that he was neere to his end, did ſo much w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his companions, that it was ſaued and brought vnto the handes of his Generall. I muſt néedes alſo recite the nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble example of the Counte <hi>de Charny,</hi> that bare the Banner of <hi>France</hi> in that ſo famous battaile of <hi>Malpertuis,</hi> néere <hi>Poitiers,</hi> which king <hi>Iohn</hi> loſt againſt <hi>Edward</hi> the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and the Engliſh men. This gentle Frenchman loued better to die in the field with the ſoueraigne Banner of <hi>France</hi> in his hande, ſtroken thorough with a thouſand blowes, than to liue with the reproch to haue fled from the Engliſhmen as farre as <hi>Poitiers,</hi> as two partes of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie did the twelfth of September, <hi>Anno. 1356.</hi> But the raunſome of ſo many priſoners was not intollerable, but moderated for the pittie and compaſſion, that they had of ſo many braue warriours, who yet layd all the falt of their foule daie on the conduct of the armie.

As ſoone as <hi>Sanchio</hi> was come to <hi>Maſtritch,</hi> hee ſent forth certaine horſemen to ſuruey his enimies armie, and to bring him word what number they were, the which they did, finding the Earle muſtering his men about
<pb facs="tcp:15178:35"/>a few miles from <hi>Maſricht,</hi> which made him abandon his firſt reſolution that he had to bid them battaile out of hand, becauſe they did dailie increaſe, ſéeing that he found himſelf farre too weake: yet the eight of March he laide an ambuſh of <hi>200.</hi> men, who ſlew certaine good ſouldiers of their eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and in ſuch ſort he kept his enimie continuallie occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied with alarmes, and ſkirmiſhes, vntill ſuch time as Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell <hi>Mondragon</hi> ariued with a new ſupplie, the which <hi>Lodouicke</hi> vnderſtanding, retired a little, and withdrewe his armie to the towne of <hi>Walkenbourg,</hi> where the <hi>18.</hi> of March, <hi>Sanchio Dauila</hi> vſing a ſtratageme, flue aboue <hi>500.</hi> of his enimies. Wherevppon they retired wholie into the towne, fearing that their armie that conſiſted almoſt of all freſh water ſouldiers, although they were moe in number, yet would bee broken by the kings armie, who were olde ſouldiers, and farre better experimented in exploites of warres, and namelie in ſuppriſes, embuſſes, and camiſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does. And when <hi>Lodouicke</hi> ſawe that by reaſon of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance that was made againſt him, it was impoſſible for him to come vnto his brother, nor to paſſe ouer the <hi>Meuſe</hi> in that quarter, he made ſemblance as though he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne backe againe into <hi>Germanie,</hi> and to that effect remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued his campe. But <hi>Sanchio Dauila</hi> doubting that he wold paſſe the riuer lower, becauſe a long time he heard no newes of him, cauſed his armie to diſmarch (the which with the regiment of <hi>Mondragon</hi> was <hi>4000.</hi> or <hi>5000.</hi> men) and as he marched a long the riuer ſide to kéepe the paſſage, he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of treaſon within the towne of <hi>Nieumegen,</hi> and how that thoſe within would yéeld vnto Comte <hi>Lodouick,</hi> that he might paſſe ouer there. Wherefore to preuent that enterpriſe, he incontinentlie thruſt a gariſon into the town, and continuallie followed his enimie, vntill ſuch time as he was aduertiſed that the Earle woulde fortefie himſelfe not far fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a ſmall village called <hi>Moken,</hi> &amp; two leagues from the kings campe, by the riuers ſide.

                  <hi>Flandets</hi> vpon the firſt occaſion that ſhould be preſented vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. Betwéene his campe and his enimies, there was a riuer without a bridge, which kept the Catholiks from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming vnto him. But <hi>Sanchio Dauila</hi> to bring his iourney to an end, and that he might léeſe no time, marched to <hi>Graue,</hi> a towne in the confines of <hi>Brabant,</hi> where he cauſed a great bridge to bée made with all poſſible ſpéede, of many Botes and Barkes, by the which he paſſed the riuer in the ſight of the Earle, and encamped himſelfe in his enimies quarter. When the Earle ſawe this, he remoued his campe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards night néerer to <hi>Moken,</hi> not being minded to fight, and ſtronglie fortefied his campe. To whom <hi>Dauila</hi> gaue many alarmes that night, fearing leaſt they would ſteale awaie priuelie in the darke. The next morning both armies ſtoode aranged in araie of battaile, and the Trumpets called to the encounter. Then <hi>Sanchio</hi> to léeſe no time, cauſed a certaine number of harquebuziers, with <hi>100.</hi> pikes, in the manner of an eſquadron, to back them, for to aſſaile the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies their trenches: al the reſt of the armie ſtanding to look what the enimie their horſemen would doe. This eſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron gaue in luſtelie on the enimie, who alſo receiued them couragiouſſie, but were at the length broken, and their tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches wonne vpon them: many of the Earles footemen, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, monie, monie, and refuſing to fight for lacke of pay, <hi>Lodouicke</hi> being rather chafed than affrighted with this vnlooked for and ſodaine flight, and trecherie of his footmen, couragiouſlie charged the enimie (whom this good happe at the beginning had made hot) with his horſemen, who alſo after many hadde ſolde their liues déerelie, were in the end forced to giue place to the force of their enimie, and to ſaue themſelues by flight.</p>

Thoſe that were in the ſhippes, diſdaining to giue place, fought ſo long, that the tide lefte them, and laide their ſhips drie, ſo that they could not get them from the Flats. By this meanes thrée and thirtie ſhips were taken, a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men ſlaine, and mightie ſtore of artillerie, and other warlike furniture taken. There was found in the ſhippes many dead bodies of them that had béene ſlaine with the Ordenance that was ſhot from the dike.</p>

               <p>The kings men vnderſtood by the priſoners that two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of <hi>Antwerpians</hi> were ſlaine in fight, and many alſo drowned, and that among other ſhippes there was one ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that carried the ſonnes of very rich Merchants, but all the men in her were ſlaine. Moreouer, not a few of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers &amp; Zelanders were ſlaine, among whome are num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred the Lord of <hi>Haultan,</hi> the gouernour of <hi>Fliſsing,</hi> two Colonells of Scottes, and Engliſh, (but in trueth there was no Engliſh Colonel ſlaine there) xiiii. other Captains, and xxix.

For whileſt the <hi>Antwerpians</hi> fought on the Dike a front the enimie: the Holanders that kept themſelues in their ſhippes plagued with their artillerie, the ſides of their enimies. This fight endured from thrée of the clocke in the morning, vntill about two in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone, and was fatall to <hi>Antwerpe,</hi> for after that time no forces were aſſembled, nor enterpriſe practiſed to relieue the Citie, which yéelded in Auguſt folowing.</p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:15178:40"/>baſe brother vnto the king of <hi>Spaine,</hi> was ordained Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and high Admirall of the Nauie, &amp; armie of the league, with whome were ioyned in Commiſſion the high Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and Generall of the Venetians and of the Pope, with decrée that to bée executed, which ſhould be allowed ano ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued of them all thrée, or elſe of anie two of them. For the execution of this league, <hi>Don Iohn</hi> departed from <hi>Spaine</hi> with fortie ſeauen Gallies, and after he had béene at <hi>Genoa</hi> and <hi>Naples</hi> about neceſſaries touching men, muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; victuals, he ariued at <hi>Meſsina</hi> in <hi>Sicile,</hi> where <hi>Mark Antonie de Colonna,</hi> and <hi>Sebaſtian Veneri,</hi> the Admiralls of the Pope and Venetians, had ſtaied for him with their Nauies, and alſo the foure Gallies of the great maiſter of <hi>Malta.</hi> There were come thether alſo the Ambaſſadours of <hi>Venice,</hi> for to ſignifie vnto the Admiralles of the conſede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, how the Turkiſh Nauie did ſo much hurt on the coaſt of <hi>Slauonie,</hi> and alſo to bée inſtant on them for ſpéedie ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour.</p>
               <p>The next daie after when the thrée Admiralls or Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralles met, accompanied and aſſiſted with other men of account, for to conſult what was beſt to bée done: <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri</hi> tolde them, that of a certaintie the Fleete of <hi>Candie</hi> would alſo bee there verie ſhortlie. But when almoſt all men doubted that it woulde be ſomewhat late before they would come, and the time of the yéere was well ſpent (for it was the <hi>22.</hi> of Auguſt) and becauſe on the other ſide it ſéemed that certaine determination could be made without them: ſome propounded this deuiſe, and ſome that. But amongſt the reſt, <hi>Aſcania de Cornia</hi> exhibited his opinion conceiued in writing to this purport. Becauſe you haue thought good (ſoueraigne Generall) that I ſhoulde declare mine opinion in writing, what I thinke ought to be done in theſe weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie affaires, with the power that we haue now, I wil ſo dee, and will beginne with the rehearſall of our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>Wee haue now as I doe thinke, <hi>146.</hi> Gallies furniſhed, ſixe great Gallies or Galeares, twentie ſhips for but then,
<pb facs="tcp:15178:40"/>and ſo many Foiſtes, and we doe looke for <hi>60.</hi> gallies out of <hi>Candy,</hi> of whome yet we haue not heard theſe many daies. Againe I doe ſuppoſe that the <hi>Turkes</hi> haue two hundreth &amp; fiftie gallies furniſhed, &amp; be in <hi>Sclauonia,</hi> where they haue an other armie on the land, of fortie or fiftie thouſand men. If this be ſo (ſoueraigne Generall) I doe not thinke, that our forces are ſo great, that we may be ſo bold as to ſeeke out the enimie, and to fight with him without apparant perill. For (we are to much inferiour, ſpecially becauſe it is likely that their nauie is paſſing wel furniſhed both with rowers and ſouldiours: for ſeeing that they haue taken three of our galleies, and to many of our ſhippes for bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deine, &amp; haue conquered all the ſea coaſt, they might if they wanted ought, repaire it eaſely, and alſo dayely take into their nauie ſouldiours, out of their armie on the land.</p>
               <p>If you can paſſe ouer hence vnto <hi>Brindiſi</hi> (in <hi>Naples</hi>) without daunger, (the which I doe leaue to be adiudged by theſe excellent men, and moſt ſkilfull in Sea affaires) I would thinke it very well ſo to doe, for hereby at the eaſt, the Venetians (whoſe affaires no doubt, are adminiſtred with great feare) would be brought into ſome hope: then alſo ſéeing we ſhould be ſo néere vnto our enimies, perhaps God would giue ſome occaſion for vs to haue a faire hand vpon them. But if it be to be feared leaſt the enimie doe méete vs by the waye: I doe not ſee what we ſhould doe, but ſtaye for the Galleies of <hi>Candy,</hi> or at the leaſt, for ſome certaine newes of them. For if we dyd knew that they would not come at all (which God forbidde) my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſe ſhould be to furniſh and arme paſſing well, as great a number of our Gallies as wée are able, and ſo to rigge them, that if they lighted on the enimies, they might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo eſcape from them by flight, and then I would giue charge to the reſt of the Galleyes to followe alſo after to <hi>Brindiſi,</hi> with the Shippes for burdeine: for with theſe gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, who happely wilbe thrée ſcore or foure ſcore in nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, we ſhold be able to ſignifie many things vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Sclauonia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:15178:41"/>and put the whole prouince, which is infeſted both by ſea &amp; land, in heart and hope: whereas other waies certes we can ſend them no ſuccour. Moreouer, if we were there, we ſhould be readie vpon euery occaſion to annoy the enimie, &amp; therewithall alſo all the whole world ſhould vnderſtand, that you (ſoueraigne Generall) were moſt readie to ſerue God, and the holy league, in all things that may be dene. But yet I would that all that I haue ſaide, may be ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted, that I had rather willingly ſubſcribe vnto them that can iudge better of this matter: and almightie God bring to paſſe that we may vſe his counſells and helpe, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an happie ende.</p>
               <p>In the meane time there hadde come vnto the Turkiſh nauie (which was at <hi>Saſeno</hi>) about the ende of Auguſt, <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemet Bey,</hi> and the Treaſorer, who brought newes that <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magoſta</hi> the chiefe citie and kaye of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> was taken, &amp; that good fidings gaue them a ſtomacke to attempt ſome new enterpriſe. But anone after when two ſmall gallies of the eſpies, had returned, and brought newes that they had chaſed a ſhippe of the Chriſtians aboue <hi>Crotone,</hi> but could not take her, but that yet they vnderſtoode that the nauie of the confederates being mette together, was in rigging at <hi>Meſsina,</hi> they leauing <hi>Saſeno,</hi> ſailed towards the <hi>Leuant</hi> or Eaſt.</p>
               <p>The caſe thus ſtanding, <hi>Mark Quirini,</hi> and <hi>Canali,</hi> ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at <hi>Meſsina</hi> the ſecond of September, with <hi>62.</hi> Galleys of <hi>Candy,</hi> and were receued with great and generall ioye, for they had ben looked for with great longing, neither could our Captaines reſolue vpon any certaintie without them. Alſo the day before came the Marques of <hi>Sancta Cruz,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Andrew Doria,</hi> with twelue Galleys, and anon after alſo <hi>40. Neapolitane</hi> ſhippes for burdeine, and thirtie Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyes, with whome alſo all the Galleys of the <hi>Palermo</hi> had ioyned themſelues.</p>
               <p>But the enimies ſailed from <hi>Saſeno</hi> to <hi>Butrinto,</hi> &amp; there taking in <hi>500.</hi> horſemen, carryed them to <hi>Corfu,</hi> that they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> waſt and made the Iland. But there the ordenance
<pb facs="tcp:15178:41"/>of the Caſtle brake and drowned thrée of their gallies, and much other harme did alſo the ſouldiours of the gariſon doe them, for our men did take many of the enimies priſoners, and among other, <hi>Baffa</hi> an Apoſtata Chriſtian, a man of great authoritie with the Emperour of the Turkes: which made them, that afterward they did not much infeſt the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbes that laie about the Caſtell. Wherefore when the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies had indomaged the Iſle as much as they coulde, they ſhipping againe their horſes, departed thence the eleauenth of September. And when they were come to <hi>Parga,</hi> there ariued a meſſenger from the great Turke, who ſignified vnto <hi>Ah,</hi> the Admirall of the Nauie, that ſéeing <hi>Famagoſta</hi> was taken, hée ſhoulde vſe the fruite of the victorie: that is, hée ſhoulde take all the Iſles néere, hée ſhould ſpare no man, yea, and ſhould alſo aſſaile farther, and deſtroie the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an fléete (as though that were in his power to doe.) Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when hée had receiued his meſſage, hée departed from thence the ſixt of September, and ſailed towards y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Leuant</hi> into the gulfe of <hi>Patras,</hi> that after hée had now furniſhed his Fléete with Biſket and other neceſſaries, hée might ſette forth to aſſaile the Chriſtians. But our men reioycing that all their forces were ioyned in one, beganne to deliberate what was to bée done. And nowe all Chriſtendome was mightelie feared with the proſperous ſucceſſes of the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and the deuaſtation of the Venetian Empire, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions. Neither had the Venetians now anie more hope than in the good will of God, and this ſame Nauie of the confederates at <hi>Meſsina.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now there were in this fléete, for the Pope twelue gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, for the king of <hi>Spaine</hi> foure ſcore and one, with twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſhips for burthen, for the Signoria of <hi>Venice</hi> one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and eight gallies, ſixe great gallies, that they call Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ares, with a good number of Fragats, and other ſmall ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping. In this fléete beſides rowers and other neceſſarie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in a fléete, were <hi>20000.</hi> Souldiours of Italians, Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niardes, and Germanes, and beſides theſe, a good indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent greate many of them that ſerued without paie (other
<pb facs="tcp:15178:42"/>authors doe make the number of them two thouſand. So then <hi>Don Iohn de Auſtria,</hi> the Admirall Generall of the league, <hi>Marke Antonie de Colonna,</hi> the high Admiral of the Popes power, <hi>Sebaſtian Veneri,</hi> the Admirall of the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian forces, conſulted what was beſt for them to attempt: there were alſo preſent at this conſultation the great Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendador of the knights of <hi>Malta, Aſcanio de Cornia, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew Doria, Auguſtine Barbarigo, Marke Quirino, Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio Canali,</hi> the Secretarie of the Venetians, with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Scribe, and ſometime alſo the Princes of Vrbine and Parma, <hi>Paulo Iordano Orſino,</hi> the Marques <hi>de Sant Cruz,</hi> &amp; other: among whom, <hi>Aſcanius de Cornia,</hi> after he had heard many mens opinions, ſpake to this effect.</p>
               <p>For two or thrée cauſes onelie, (moſt Honourable) may a Generall with honour refraine to ioyne in battaile with his enimie. Of whome the firſt is, if hée ſhall gaine leſſe profite by the fruite of the victorie, than hée maye feare de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment if hée happe to bée ouerthrowen: whereof take this example. When the Duke of <hi>Guyſe</hi> not many yéeres agoe, had inuaded the kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Alua</hi> had done vnwiſelie, if hée would haue giuen him bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle: for the French could haue loſt no more in that bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle than their armie, but if the victorie had inclined to the French partie, wée dyd leeſe with our armie the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Naples</hi> too.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, if he doe vnderſtand that his enimies ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie will bée broken and ſcattered without fight: whereof the inuincible Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, your Highneſſe his Father, of ſacred memorie, maye bée an example. For when hee made warres againſt the Proteſtants in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,</hi> he wold neuer ioyne in battaile with them, becauſe hée vnderſtood that their armie would bée diſpearſed without battaile, neither could the ſtrength of that league long indure and continue.</p>
               <p>Finallie, for a third cauſe may a Generall ſhunne bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile: if he doe know that his power is ſo much inferiour to his enimies, that hée can in no wiſe hope for victorie. But
<pb facs="tcp:15178:42"/>(moſt Honourable) none of the former cauſes dubtleſſe can moue vs, for although the loſſe of this Nauie of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans bée a matter of verie great conſequence, as ſome haue ſayde before mée, and that wée doe graunt that the victorie will fall on our enimies ſide, yet notwithſtanding if wée do fight valiantlie, as it becommeth vs, it is likelie alſo that their Nauie will bée ſo ſore ſhaken and ſpoiled, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bée eaſilie and lightlie repaired by the Turke: neither againe are our Princes of ſo ſmall ſtrength, that they ſhall not bée able to repaire our power, at the leaſt as much as ſhall bée ſufficient for to defend their owne. But if that we doe obtaine the victorie, then whereas wée may hope for other greater matters, than ſpeciallie the enfranchiſement of <hi>Greece.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreouer, the which we ought chiefelie to conſider, and holde for a certaine (as I haue often admoniſhed alſo héere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore) that we can doe nothing, neither with this preſent power, neither with anie other that ſhall bée ſupplied vnto vs hereafter, nor doe anie thing of moment agaynſt the Turkes, except that we haue firſt deſaited and broken their Nauie.</p>
               <p>But that it will be diſpearſed through wearineſſe or lacke of things neceſſarie, we cannot hope: but rather our enimies may promiſe themſelues the ſame of vs. Séeing then that our power is now ſo great, that we may hope for victorie in battaile: mine opinion is, that in anie wiſe wée ought to fight, neither is this preſent occaſion in anio eaſe to be let ſlippe. But whether our forces be ſo great as theirs, that in déede is to be conſidered. The forces conſiſt, as farre as I can conceiue, in men and in gallies. As for the men, yea, although they be ſuch as it hath ſayd before me, that is to wit, that the Spaniardes and Italians are for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter parte freſh water Souldiours, and of ſmall experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and alſo that the Almanes are of ſmall ſeruice in Sea fight, and that there is but a ſmall number of Harquebuziers amonge them: yet I doe not ſee howe
<pb facs="tcp:15178:43"/>our enimies can by anie meanes be in this point better fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, both by reaſon of the great plague that we doe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand raged and raigned in their nauie the laſt yéere, and alſo becauſe they are forced to haue a great armie in <hi>Ciprus.</hi> But now of the greatneſſe of their Nauie we doe heare di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe reportes, ſo that I cannot pronounce of certaintie, whether that ours bée the greater of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſmaller. For ſéeing I am ſmallie experimented in ſea affaires, I cannot tell with how many, or how great common gallies, and Foiſts of the Turkes, our great Gallies may bee matched: wherefore I will leaue the iudgement of theſe things vnto other. This onelie I doe pronounce and thinke, that wée muſt trie for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune: for warre matters cannot ſo be managed, but that fortune may doe much in them. Therefore let vs departe hence with this Fléete, and ſaile either towards <hi>Brindiſi</hi> or <hi>Corfu:</hi> for when wée ſhall bée ſo néere our enimies, wée ſhall bée able to vnderſtand ſome certaintie of their ſtate, and thereby take aduiſe: and vnleſſe ſome difficultie of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting victualls doe let, I doe thinke it better that we ſaile to <hi>Corfu</hi> than to <hi>Brindiſi,</hi> becauſe the enimie muſt néeds paſſe that waie when he ſaileth into the Leuant. But before wée doe departe hence, I doe thinke that wée muſt firſt and chiefelie doe one thing, and that is, fullie and aſſuredlie to determine with our ſelues that wée muſt fight, and let this bée the firme and fixed reſolution of vs, that whenſoeuer wée ſhall light vpon our enimies, that wée will aſſaile them, and to this ende let all thinges bée before hand diſpoſed and ordered. For if wée goe hence doubtfull, then wée ſhall bée forced to take aduice at the verie inſtant, and if wée doe chaunce to fall vpon our enimies on a ſodaine, wée béeing out of order and vncertain what to do, ſhall eaſilie bée ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen and ſcattered. And theſe are the things (moſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable) that I doe thinke wée ought to doe: but yet ſo, that I will willinglie ſubſcribe to them of more ſkill.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Cornia</hi> had made an ende of his ſpéech, all men
<pb facs="tcp:15178:43"/>aſſented to that he had ſayd: for they being forced by neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie did vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that this was the onely way to doe wel, for to ſet vppon the enimie couragiouſly, when occaſion ſhould be offered. Wherefore <hi>Don Iohn</hi> that he might omit nothing that dyd beſéeme a good Generall, commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded what euery man ſhould doe afterward, and how and in what order they ſhould goe foorth. He deuided all the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie into foure battailes: that is to wit, two winges, a middle battaile, which they called the fight, and ſecret ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours. In the eight wing were <hi>53.</hi> Galleies, vnder the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of <hi>Iohn Andrew Doria,</hi> and they had a gréene flagge, in the toppe of the maſt. The left wing conſiſted of the like number of galleies, and were ledde by <hi>Auguſtine Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barigo,</hi> with a yelow flagge in the ſtarre-bord ſide of the maſt. The middle battaile, wherein were <hi>61.</hi> galleies, dyd the General himſelfe <hi>Don Iohn</hi> gouerne, and he had a blew or ſkye couler flagge. Theſe thrée battailes conſiſted of <hi>161.</hi> Galleies, and were ſo enſtructed, that the middle bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes with the two winges, on either ſide néere to it, went forth with equall pace, one neither before nor behinde an other: but the winges were ſo farre diſtant from the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle battaile: that thrée or foure gallies might be put into that voide ſpace betwéene them: the which was left to that ende, that euery one of the battailes, might turne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues as vſe and profit ſhould require. <hi>Aluares de Baſan,</hi> the Marques <hi>de Sancta Cruz,</hi> commaunded ouer the battaile of ſuccour, whoſe flagge was white, borne in the puppe. But this battaile had <hi>38.</hi> galleies, of whome eight vnder their Cheifteine <hi>Iohn de Cordona,</hi> went about <hi>20.</hi> or <hi>25.</hi> miles before all the fléete, for to deſcrie: and had in commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for to ſignifie vnto the fléete by ſwift fragats, what they had ſéene, or found: but if they ſhould deſcrie ſo great a number of Shippes, that they ſuſpected it to be the Nauie of the enimie, then they ſhould retire to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſt of the fléete, and foure of them ſuccour the left winge, and ſo many with <hi>Cordona,</hi> the right.</p>
               <p>The great galleies, that are called Galeazes, and were
<pb facs="tcp:15178:44"/>ſet about halfe a mile before the middle battaile, and the winges: and <hi>Antonie</hi> and <hi>Ambroſe Bragadini</hi> had the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the two that went before the left wing, and the two that went before the middle battaile were gouerned by <hi>Iames Guory</hi> and <hi>Antonie Duodi,</hi> and they that went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the right wing, were commaunded by <hi>Andrew Piſau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi> and <hi>Peter Piſano.</hi> But euerie one of the Galeazes were almoſt a mile one from another, that they might after a ſorte protect and gouerne the whole Fleete: and becauſe, they that were not ſo eaſilie rowed with oares, as the reſt of the Gallies, the high Admirall Generall had commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that if the winde did not ſerue for them to ſayle, that then they ſhoulde be towed by other Galleyes, whereof he had diſtrivuted the charge to certaine Captaines: for he himſelf &amp; <hi>Colonna</hi> had taken vpon them to tow with theyr Galleies, the Admiral Galeaze of <hi>Frances Duodi,</hi> &amp; had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Galeaze of <hi>Iames Gori</hi> to <hi>Sebaſtian Veneri,</hi> &amp; to <hi>Chriſtopher Leyni,</hi> the Galeaze of <hi>Andrew Bragadini,</hi> to <hi>Auguſtine Barbarigo,</hi> the Galeaze of <hi>Antonie Bragadini,</hi> to <hi>Antonie Canali,</hi> the Galleaze of <hi>Andrew Piſauro,</hi> to the Prior of <hi>Meſsina:</hi> and the Galleaze of <hi>Peter Piſano</hi> to <hi>Iohn Andrew Doria.</hi> The high Admirall Generall hadde choſen a place for himſelfe in the verie middeſt of the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, and was garded on the right ſide with <hi>Antonie Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonna</hi> the Admirall of the Popes Nauie, and on the lefte, with <hi>Sebaſtian Veniero,</hi> the high Admirall of the Venetian Nauie.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Colonna</hi> was ſtrengthned on the other by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall Galley of Genowayes, whereof <hi>Hector Spinola</hi> was Captaine, and hee had with him the Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi> and <hi>Venerio</hi> was alſo defenced on the lefte ſide with the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall Galley of <hi>Sauoy,</hi> of whome <hi>Leyni</hi> had the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſhe alſo carried the Prince of Vrbine. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde at the puppe, the Admirall Generall, <hi>Colonna</hi> and <hi>Venerio,</hi> had the Galley called the Prince of Spaine, and alſo the Galley of the greate Commendador of <hi>Caſtilia.</hi> The right ſide of the middle battayle, where it was ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
<pb facs="tcp:15178:44"/>from the wing, dyd the Admirall of <hi>Malta</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Prior of <hi>Meſsina,</hi> cloſe vp, but the lefte ſide the Captaine of <hi>Peter Lomelyno,</hi> vnder the gouernement of <hi>Paulo Iordano Orſino.</hi> At the right wing <hi>Iohn de Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clona</hi> had ioyned himſelfe to the ſide of <hi>Doria.</hi> In the lefte wing <hi>Auguſtine Barbarigo</hi> had on the one ſide <hi>Marke Quirini,</hi> and on the other <hi>Canali.</hi> But in all the battayles, Galleyes of the king of Spaine, of the popes, and of the Signories of Venice were blended together without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction. Theſe things being diſpatched, the high Admirall Generall commanded all the Captains and Maiſters of the Gallies, that they ſhould do their beſt for to ſee that al thoſe vnder their charges did leade a godlie and holie life, for ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it would not come to paſſe, that God, ſpeciallie, in ſo iuſt a cauſe woulde help them in that they went about. Things being thus ordered, they departed from <hi>Meſsina</hi> the ſixtenth of September, being Sundaie, hauing ſent the ſhippes for burthen the daie before, vnder their Captain <hi>Iohn Dauolos,</hi> and vpon ſundrie occurrents and occaſions went to diuerſe places in the kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi> and then backe againe to <hi>Palermo</hi> in <hi>Sicile,</hi> and from thence to ſundrie places in the Iſle of <hi>Corfu,</hi> and then to port Gomenizearo, a great &amp; ſafe hauen on the continent. Here becauſe the weather was clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and they had no good windes, they thought good to ſuruey their Nauie, that if anie thing lacked, they might prouide it, and the ſame night ariued there <hi>Gildas Andrada,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Baptiſta Contarini,</hi> who had giuen in as far as Zante, &amp; had learned that the <hi>28.</hi> of September the enimie was in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gulf of <hi>Patras,</hi> &amp; their Nauie was in ill caſe, for about ten of their Foiſts &amp; ſmall gallies, with the <hi>Moceniga,</hi> &amp; <hi>Conſtantina,</hi> ſhips for burthen, carrying ſicke men (the which was yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward found to be falſe) were gone toward <hi>Modone:</hi> the which newes made all our men growe in heart and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and excited them to purſue the enimie. But yet the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe tempeſt continued ſtill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherefore the high Admirall commaunded the firſt of October that all things ſhoulde be layde vp in their places, and the next daie hee tooke
<pb facs="tcp:15178:45"/>a generall muſter, and ſpoiled foure Galleies of all their ſouldiours and equippage, that he might furniſh the reſt the better. The ſixt of October the winde was layde, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ioyfully launched out of Port <hi>Gomenizearo,</hi> and had their Nauie thus particularly diſtributed, and their battailes thus arranged,</p>

               <p>The Nauie being thus diſtributed, they ſailed forth, and euerie man was carefull for his charge, the which, that it might bée the more exactlie done, the Generall had alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a Captaine ouer euerie <hi>20.</hi> gallies, who ſhuld dily<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentlie looke that this order were obſerued by them all. So they ſailed to <hi>Cefalonia</hi> where they receiued Letters from <hi>Paule Contarini</hi> the gouernour of the Iſle of <hi>Zante,</hi> that ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified how the enimies fléete was in the gulfe of <hi>Patras</hi> in ill caſe, and that fortie veſſels were gone awaie vnder the gouernment of <hi>Oluzali</hi> towards <hi>Modone,</hi> nor long after they receiued Letters from <hi>Famagoſta.</hi> Which things bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing knowen, our men were full perſwaded that they ought to goe forward and to aſſaile the enimie.</p>
               <p>But whether in the meane time were our enimies idle, for when <hi>Ali</hi> their high Admirall was come to <hi>Lepanto,</hi> within the gulfe of <hi>Patras,</hi> the <hi>28.</hi> of September he ſent <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemet Bey,</hi> with thrée ſcore galleyes to <hi>Aſpropitio,</hi> a Citie within that gulfe, for to bring thence victualls, and ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſouldiours, that he might be redie for all euents. And he had now diſpatched the matter, and being returned, hadde brought beſides victualls and other neceſſaries <hi>10000.</hi> Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizares, <hi>2000.</hi> common ſouldiours, and as many voluntarie. In the meane time he had vnderſtoode that our fléete was come from <hi>Corfu</hi> to <hi>Cefalenia,</hi> but of the greatneſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, or what they meant to doe, he had yet learned no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie, for although that <hi>Caracoza,</hi> being ſent to take view of our Nauie, had brought word backe, that hée had dily<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentlie ſurueied it, and that there were not in it aboue <hi>150.</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:15178:50"/>Galleyes: yet that was falſe. But yet notwithſtanding as though they did fore-ſée their miſfortune, all in the fléete were afraide. Wherefore <hi>Ali,</hi> albeit he was fullie reſolued to fight, yet for that cauſe and reaſon he thought good to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult with the principall men that he had with him, what was to be done héerein, before that he did put theſe newe aides and ſupplie into his gallies. Wherevpon hauing cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led together all the chiefe men of marke and authoritie, and the moſt ſkilfull in martiall matters, he gaue euerie man large leaue fréelie to vtter what they thought. They ſate long in counſaile, for many to gratifie <hi>Ali,</hi> whom they knew was reſolued to fight, affirmed that fortune was to bée tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: neither on the contrarie part were there few that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed vnto <hi>Portau Baſſa,</hi> the Generall of the ſouldiours, who held it ſtiflie that they ought in no caſe to ſight. Thus when diuerſe opinions were ſpoken by diuerſe men, <hi>Haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan Baſſan,</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Barbaroſſa,</hi> ſometime king of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gier,</hi> hauing craued licenſe to ſpeake, and laying his hande vpon his breaſt, according to the vſage of that Nation, ſpake to this effect.</p>
               <p>Moſt excellent and mightie aboue all other, beloued and aduanced by the maieſtie of our moſt inuincible Emperor, vnto the higheſt degrée of glorie, men moſt deſirous to doe ſeruice vnto the immeſurable glorie of our Emperor, which is the ſhadowe and ſpirite of the liuing God for euer and euer. Theſe Idolaters are in diuine matters worſe than beaſtes, and enimies of the true ſonne of God. Therefore I woulde not haue you doubt whether their Nauie ought to bée aſſailed and taken. For beſides thoſe ſignes that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny before mée haue wiſelie rehearſed, wée may certainlie knowe by the priſoners, that theſe men are of the ſame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and gathered together after the ſame order, that they were that thirtie yéeres agoe, béeing ioyned together w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a great number of Galleyes, in theſe verie ſame ſeas, were broken by <hi>Hariadin Barbareſſa</hi> my Father, with ſo greate facilitie, that hée neuer néeded to doe ſo much as once to brawe his ſword. For although they had a greater Nauie
<pb facs="tcp:15178:50"/>than my Father had, yet as ſoone as they ſawe the beakes of our Gallies, and heard the crie and valiant féeſe of our men, they betooke them to flight: for they are ſo faint hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that they runne awaie as ſoone as they doe heare of our name. Beſides this, they being blended together of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe Nations, doe mutuallie hate one another, neither wil anie one of them obey another, the which is a matter of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie great moment in an armie: there be a great number of Gallies of diuerſe Princes come together, not for to expoſe themſelues to anie perill for their common defence, but that they may ſéeme to haue a great Nauie. They be blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, deſpiſers of God; apparelled and furniſhed with rich and precious clothes, and armour, and laden with monie. But we on the other ſide are ignorant what blaſphemie is, and doe mutuallie loue and reuerence one another, and are met together héere in armes to this onelie end, that we may doe our onelie Emperor, alwaies inuincible Prince, ſeruice in fight. And ſéeing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al our men haue aſſembled to this end, they will with one minde obey your valiant aduiſes, and chieflie becauſe they doe know that ye are the lieuetenants of our Emperor himſelfe, &amp; therfore fighting as it beſeemeth valiant and well appointed men, will carrie awaie aſſured victorie. And this we may the more lightly hope, becauſe we haue <hi>280.</hi> veſſells well furniſhed, of whom <hi>200.</hi> are common Gallies, and fiftie ſmall Gallies, all of them paſſing well armed: to the augmentation of whoſe power &amp; ſtrength yet more, and to the farther encouragement of our moſt valiant men, if that ye do diſtribute &amp; put into the gallies y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>14000.</hi> men, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> came verie latelie, &amp; alſo thoſe of the Leuant that are in the <hi>20.</hi> foiſts, we ſhal reſt aſſured of the victorie, although we doe grant that our enimies are valiant men. But now we doe certainlie know, as we haue learned of our fellow <hi>Caracoza,</hi> a verie wiſe man, that they haue but <hi>150.</hi> gallies furniſhed with ſuch men, as I told you before. Wherefore (moſt valiant and wiſe Gentlemen) ſéeing that we do ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entlie know their ſtate, goe forward, ye ſhall finde them in the vale of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and diſpearſed along that ſhoare,
<pb facs="tcp:15178:51"/>more giuen to idleneſſe, eaſe, delights, and delicatenes, than is méete for warriours, ſo that thereby, ye ſhall take them al without difficultie, for when they ſhall ſée our Fléete, they either flying awaie, will runne on the ſhore, and ſuffer ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke, or elſe they will light and fall on our Nauie, and be taken.</p>
               <p>But that I maye comprehend all the matter in fewe wordes: we haue the greater number of veſſels, and them alſo better furniſhed than our enimies, verie valiant and ſkilfull ſouldiours: wherefore wée muſt not let ſlip this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion offered vs to fight with them, that are ſo much infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour vnto vs, in number, proweſſe, and experience, and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie, ſéeing that thereby wée ſhall execute the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our high and mightie Emperour, whoſe glorie ſhall indure for euer, and winne our ſelues immortall praiſe: but ye namelie, ſhall performe that which yée promiſed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this our ſupreame Emperour, when he appointed you in his owne place for to conduct this moſt mightie Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie.</p>
               <p>The ſame arguments vſed alſo at that time <hi>Oluzali,</hi> the Chieftaine of the forces of <hi>Barbarie,</hi> vſing a long ſpéech of the power of the Turkes, and of the commandement and anger of the great Emperour of the Turkes, who, as alſo <hi>Cayabeg,</hi> the Sanzach of <hi>Smyrne,</hi> ſhewed with an effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſpéech, that neither they ought, nor coulde without ſhame let paſſe this occaſion, to deſtroie the ſame Chriſtians, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing now a leſſer power, ſéeing that they had alwayes ben defaitad and ſpoiled héeretofore by the ſouldiours of <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> the great Emperour of the <hi>Turkes,</hi> although they had a fléete farre better furniſhed than theirs.</p>
               <p>But of a flat contrarie minde were <hi>Syrocke</hi> the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zach or gouernour of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Carabiue</hi> the Captain of <hi>Suuraſar,</hi> both verie ancient Captaines, and ſingularlie well experimented in ſea affaires, and many other beſides. But <hi>Mehemet Bey</hi> the Sanzach of <hi>Nigreponto,</hi> who ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time had gouerned <hi>Barbarie,</hi> going about to extinguiſh this hot fire of <hi>Haſſan Baſſa,</hi> ſpake to this ſenſe.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:15178:51"/>
               <p>I doe thinke and iudge (moſt prudent péeres) that the wordes y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Haſſan Baſſa</hi> hath ſpoken, are ſignes and tokens of a verie valiant man, and namelie of him, that deſireth in all things to obey our moſt inuincible Lorde and king of kings, who draweth his ſword with the arme of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and liueth for euer and euer, yet notwithſtanding ſéeing it ſo pleaſeth you, the <hi>Baſſaes</hi> your excellencies, who next after our ſupreame Emperour doth deſerue this Empire of <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will alſo ſpeake what I doe thinke: doubtleſſe it is likelie y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> our enimies would not haue come in this far, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they had before diligentlie learned out our ſtrength &amp; forces, wherefore it muſt néedes be, that they haue a power at the leaſt equall to ours, or elſe greater: becauſe that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they would neuer haue come thus farre. Of the which thing this may bée an argument: that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues may eaſilie knowe, that the hope of kéeping and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing of the reſt of their dominions and Empire that is left them, or of recouering that which they haue loſt, doth lie in this onelie Nauie. Therefore let vs not beléeue that this Fléete of our enimies hath come hether for to expoſe them ſelues to manifeſt perill, and to caſt awaie themſelues wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie: the which they muſt néedes doe, if their Nauie be ſo ſimple, as it hath béene painted out vnto vs, &amp; alſo ſo ſmall as our fellow <hi>Caracoza,</hi> yet a man of great proweſſe, hath affirmed.</p>
               <p>I for mine owne parte doe ſurelie thinke, that a Nauie that commeth from <hi>Sicile</hi> thus farre, to ſéeke their enimie, ſpeciallie at this time of the yéere, is verie well appointed, and doth come with certaine aduiſe and purpoſe to fight, &amp; with hope to obtaine the victorie. And if we doe diligentlie wey the thing, we vnderſtand that the reports of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian priſoners doe in all pointes agrée héerewithall, for if they would onelie vantinglie and vainlie ſhew themſelues, and then flie awaie, what néede they to haue come ſo farre vp into theſe our ſeas? What? That they flying awaie, might léeſe all? Wherefore grounding your ſelues vppon
<pb facs="tcp:15178:52"/>theſe arguments, thinke that the Nauie of our enimies is verie ſtrong, and hath determined to fight with vs, ſéeing that they are come vp thus farre, not prouoked nor forced by vs, but of their owne accord: Neither haue wée reaſon to compare this fléete with that which our men in former yéeres did put to flight at <hi>Preueſa.</hi> For this league of the Chriſtian Princes againſt vs is another manner of thing, than y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which was made thirtie yéeres agoe, the preparation other, the ſkil in warfare other, ſo that ther is no proportion betwéene them. In that fléete were many and diuerſe Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralls, but little wiſedome, and that was the cauſe that they fled: In this Nauie is <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> the ſonne of the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, and the brother of <hi>Philip</hi> the king of <hi>Spaine,</hi> a verie valiant man, and one excited by his Fathers glorie, and inuited by the ſupreame degrée of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, that he hath obtained in this league through his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; finallie, one beloued and reuerenced of all the whole Nauie, the Captaines, and Souldiours with one &amp; common conſent. And therefore without all doubt he will giue vs battaile, neither without hope of victorie.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, the Venetians, becauſe they haue béen ſo déep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie endamaged by vs, can (being almoſt mad for anger) ſéeke nothing elſe but reuenge: that is to wit, becauſe we haue flaine ſo many of their people: whom to be all verie valiant men, we haue learned by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great loſſe of many of our men: &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> certes we wil the more eaſilie beléeue, if we do cal to mind how the ſame Venetians went about the laſt yéere to giue vs battaile, although they had not then entered into league with theſe other Princes. Therefore without doubt they wil fight, &amp; the more fiercelie, becauſe they being lead with emulation, wil indeuour one to excell another in prowes, &amp; euerie man preferre his owne Nation before others, the which thing I haue alwaies thought to be a matter of verie great moment in warres. And this alſo am I the rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to thinke, becauſe we doe heare, that <hi>Don Iohn</hi> is an hardie and venterous young man, a contemner of danger, and golde, and one that couetetl, and careth for nothing ſo
<pb facs="tcp:15178:52"/>much, as that the fame of his valour may runne euen to the fartheſt coaſts of <hi>Spaine.</hi> To bring the which thing to paſſe, can he ſéeke for a more commodious occaſion than this is? Séeing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he hath them his helpers, who being endomaged by vs, doe burne in deſire of fight, and there with all hope, that as ſoone as they haue diſcomfited our Nauie, they ſhal ſoone recouer all that they haue loſt? The which things cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, if they ſhould happen, not onelie the glorie, but alſo a a great part of thoſe things that they ſhuld get, yea, and the Lordſhip of this whole ſea euen to the Eaſt, wil redound to him.</p>
               <p>But if contrariwiſe, he ſhould runne awaie, would hée euer dare to come into his brothers ſight againe? Alſo, the Venetians, that haue diligentlie ſought and ſearched theſe ſeas, where could they ſéeke to ſaue themſelues, if they ſhuld betake them to flight? Therefore let vs thinke that they haue carefullie conſidered all theſe things, in whom the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of their liues, goods, and Empire doth lie, and that they will all fight-together moſt valiantlie, the which they did not at <hi>Preueſa.</hi> But we are now in this gulfe, a place well defenced both by nature, and two verie ſtrong Caſtles, and we haue as good meanes to get victuals and ſouldiours as we our ſelues would wiſh. But before we ariued here, we wonderfullie afflicted our enimies: we waſted a parte of the Iſle of <hi>Candie,</hi> we deſtroyed <hi>Cerigo</hi> with fire, and harrying. The like we did in <hi>Zante,</hi> &amp; <hi>Cefalenia:</hi> we great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie anoied <hi>Corfu,</hi> we recouered <hi>Suppoto,</hi> we entered into the gulfe of <hi>Venice,</hi> and there we tooke <hi>Antiuari</hi> and <hi>Dulcino,</hi> Townes nothing ſmall, with many other places and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.</p>
               <p>We burnt <hi>Budua,</hi> and with ſo greate triumph we came at the laſt into this gulfe. Can we not hold our ſelues con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with theſe glorious giftes for this time, ſpeciallie ſéeing that we doe vnderſtand our men haue taken <hi>Famo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goſta,</hi> and conſerued the whole kingdome of <hi>Ciprus</hi> at this verie ſame time?</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:15178:53"/>
               <p>Surelie it is no leſſe vertue to kéepe things gotten, than to get them: for when we doe attempt to win things by force, that enterpriſe hath a doubtfull beginning, and is moſt commonlie much ſubiect to fortune: but the kéeping of things gotten hath a certaine and finall end, which may bée attributed to the counſaile of a wiſe Generall. But of our great Emperour, this doe I certes promiſe you, that he will accept as well the ſafetie of this Nauie, and will as much commend you, for that ye haue not expoſed it to apparant perill, &amp; for the waſting of ſo many prouinces, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering of kingdoms &amp; cities, &amp; for the preſentation vnto him of ſo great a ſpoile of all kinde of riches. For it will aſke vs many yéeres to furniſh ſo great a fléet, but our enimies wil prepare a greater within a ſhort time. Wherefore my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is, (moſt excellent) who are the ſoule of our greate Emperour, the ſafetie of the Ottomanicall Empire, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune is not to be attempted, but our Nauie is to bée verie carefullie and curiouſtie ſpread out, and ſet forth in good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and arraie within this gulfe, and that we doe expect in this ſafe place what our enimies minde to doe: this daie or to morrow they will be come as we doe heare vnto <hi>Zante,</hi> and <hi>Cefalenia,</hi> and ye thereby taking occaſion ſhall knowe what may be done with moſt ſafetie, for wheras in all mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall matters, then ſpeciallie in nauall, it is of great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to catch the occaſion, of doing things fortunatlie and ſafelie.</p>
               <p>All which things I doe vnderſtand that yée know better than I: and therefore I doe hope that ye will take aduiſe of thoſe things that ſhal be ſtill reported vnto you, and that I doe truſt ye wil doe ſo much the more, becauſe the enimie cannot ſtaie there long by reaſon of hard comming by vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals, and alſo becauſe the place is nothing ſafe. For the which cauſes doubtleſſe, one of theſe two thinges will hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen vnto them, that either they will be conſtrained to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne backe from whence they came, or elſe they will come forward to méete with vs,</p>
               <p>But if that they ſhall reſolue to goe forth to méete vs, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
<pb facs="tcp:15178:53"/>I doe not know whether they can come into this gulfe, and if they doe come in, it cannot bée done without greate daunger, for we being defenced with two Caſtles, ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noie them ſafelie, and ſhall know without coniectures and of a certaintie, how great their forces bée. And if wée ſhall ſéeme to be ſuperior, we may ſafelie aſſaile them, if not, then remaine heere ſafelie without anie danger of our Nauie, or Empire, and yet neuertheleſſe retaine, and maintaine the dignitie and honour of our ſelues, and our great Emperour. Neither is there cauſe why we ſhoulde in anie wiſe feare, that they wandering on this coaſt, will farrie héere longer than we would, for that they can in no caſe doe for lacke of victualls, and for ill weather, vſuall at this time of the yere. And if they wold go about it, they ſhuld do it with greater daunger of themſelues than of vs, becauſe the difficultie of the time of the yéere, wil trouble and make rough theſe ſeas now euerie daie, and will ſcatter their Fléete, whereby we may take occaſion for to inuade them being diſpearſed here and there.</p>
               <p>But yet I woulde not that we ſhould bée idle in the meane time, but ſéeke to learne by all induſtrie (ſending ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie eſpies) the power and purpoſe of our enimies: for ſo, if that wée haue diligentlie learned their ſtate, wée maye take and follow that aduiſe which ſhall bée moſt for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite and dignitie of our Emperour. But to goe forth out of this well fortified and ſtrong place, while wée are yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine of all thinges, and to commit our ſelues vnto the daliance of fortune, doe I déeme to bée an action nothing praiſe worthie.</p>
               <p>I doe not doubt but that our enimies will buſilie goe about to prouoke vs out of this ſtrong place: and that they will doe, béeing forced either by the time of the yeare, or the ſeaſon of the weather, but then it ſtands with your wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to moderate and ſtaie your ſelues ſo much the more. By the which wiſe parte, yée ſhall get no leſſe praiſe and opinion of wiſedome, than yée haue alreadie gained in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering ſo greate a kingdome, and winning ſo many Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb facs="tcp:15178:54"/>and Caſtles, becauſe through your wiſedome in this point, yée may ſéeme to haue conſerued the Empire of <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet I would haue all that I haue ſayd, to bée ſo taken, that neuertheleſſe I am readie to yéeld and obey your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſes and reſolutions, and will ſpend my life in the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them.</p>
               <p>This ſpéech of <hi>Mahemet Bey</hi> liked <hi>Portau Baſſa</hi> verie well, and alſo the Sanzaches <hi>Syrocke,</hi> and <hi>Caraby</hi> did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue it: but yet becauſe they had contrarie commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from <hi>Sultan Selim,</hi> the which was then publikelie read by the commandement of <hi>Oluzali,</hi> and for that <hi>Ali</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing verie deſirous to fight, had drawen many to take his part, and moſt chieflie becauſe it was the good pleaſure of God, that the deſtruction of that Nation ſhoulde one daie haue a beginning, they decréed by common conſent for to depart thence, and to giue the Chriſtians battaile. For they did thinke that they ſhould finde our Nauie in the Hauen, without men, and ſo ſhoulde without much a doe take it: the which falling out ſo, they had determined to conquere alſo <hi>Zante</hi> and <hi>Cefalenia,</hi> and then beſieging in the Winter the places of ſtrength in <hi>Candie</hi> and <hi>Corfu,</hi> and in ſucceſſe of time entering into the gulfe of <hi>Catato,</hi> for to winne theſe and other places of the Venetian Empire, &amp; ſo make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues a waie into <hi>Italie,</hi> and all Chriſtendome. Wherefore they did diſtribute into their Gallies the <hi>14000.</hi> ſouldiors that came latelie, they did manakle the Chriſtian priſoners, that they ſhould be apt for nothing elſe but to rowe, &amp; then aranged all the whole Fléete into foure battailes, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>

               <p>The Nauie being diſtributed in this manner, they lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched forth the ſeauenth of October, and came to the coaſt of <hi>Galanga,</hi> two houres before Sunne ſet, and there they ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But our men, becauſe they had decréed to fight, determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with common conſent to depart out of hand from the vale of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> that making towardes <hi>Patras,</hi> they might doe what in them laie, to prouoke the enimie to bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile. Yea, and if perhaps they would refuſe it, that then they ſhould goe farther forth, euen vnto the mouth of the gulfe of <hi>Patras,</hi> and by battering the Caſtels, and pittifullie waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> places adioyning, vrge thenimie to battaile. Therfore <hi>Don Iohn,</hi> the high Admirall Generall, beeing verie deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, that thoſe things which had béene decréed by common counſaile, might bee executed, and namelie being at that time earneſtlie deſired and egged on by <hi>Auguſtine Barbarigo,</hi> a verie valiant man, and verie zealous of the Venetian ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, departed from the vale the ſame night, which went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſeauenth of October, béeing Sundaie, although hee had no verie good winde, and kept his courſe to wardes the rockes <hi>Cruzulari,</hi> which are not farre from the maine, with the intent to aſſaile the enimie the next morning in the breake of the daie.</p>
               <p>But they on the other ſide had the ſame ſaterdaie ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed great ſigne of ioy, triumphing before the victorie, becauſe they thought that they had now alreadie gotten our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie wholie at their deuotion, and wrought their pleaſure therewithall. Wherefore they alſo launched from thence the eight of October, verie earlie in the morning, hoping to finde our men yet in the Hauen, for they did not thinke that they woulde méete them, and were now in their waie. And ſo they ſailed with their Sailes ſomewhat lowe, and a good winde towardes <hi>Cefalenia,</hi> and as if GOD hadde of his immeaſurable power then directed theſe
<pb facs="tcp:15178:59"/>two moſt mightie fléets, one againſt another, although they were neuer aboue twelue miles one from other, yet one of them all this while did not ſée another, for certaine eminences of the lande, one ſailing againſte another, not farre from the Nauie. And when both kept on their courſe, and our Nauie was gotten out from the Rockes <hi>Cruzula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri,</hi> in no verie good araie, becauſe the rockes did impeach them, and our enimies were paſſing the foreland called <hi>Peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieras,</hi> and of the Gréekes <hi>Meſolognias:</hi> they did firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrie one another. Wherefore our men reioyced that they had happilie eſpied their enimie, and now they beganne to make all things readie for the fight, they ſet vp their net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, they laied weapons of all ſortes at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſides of the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyes, and in other conuenient places, they armed the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours with harquebuſſes, holbards, pikes, pollaxes, and ſwords, and diſpoſed them in their places: and there were in euerie common gallie almoſt <hi>200.</hi> men that vſed ſwords: &amp; in the Admirals (as ſome were greater than another) <hi>300.</hi> and in ſome <hi>400.</hi> men. Which things béeing diſpatched, they beſtowed the great Guns in their places, béeing charged with chaine ſhot, and other ſquare ſhot, and ſtones, and brought forth trunkes to caſt wilde fire with all. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing made readie all things with ſingular diligence, at laſt they enfranchiſed all the Chriſtian priſoners that had béene condemned to the oare, pulling off their yrons, and armed them for to fight valiantlie for the name of Chriſt, who had made them frée, and without difference mingled them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt: and they in hope to obtaine libertie, did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to performe the duetie of valiant Souldiours. And whileſt that theſe thinges were thus in dooing, euerie Galleie was come into his appointed place, and the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leazes hadde be towed thether whereas they ſhoulde bée, by them to whome the charge hadde béene committed, and now all the whole Fléete was with ſingular ſilence ſette and placed in conuenient order and araie. But our enimies comming on-ward as faſt as we, dyd alſo prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to fight.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:15178:59"/>
               <p>And when they ſaw that <hi>Iohn Andrew Doria,</hi> the Captain of the right wing, being accompanied with many Galleies, ſtretched out his wing more into the ſeaward, they hadde thought that he had fledde. As alſo many of our men when they ſaw the enimies to make out into the ſea with their ſailes hoiſed vp aloft, they then thought that the enimie had fledde. And this falſe coniecture on both ſides, made both our men, and our enimies the more bold and couragious to fight. The two Nauies being thus furniſhed &amp; arranged, did ſet forward to fight valiantly, and occupied ſo great a ſpace of the ſea, as ſéemed vnto them ſufficient to kéepe them from running on the ſhore, and making thereby ſhipwrack, and ſo came faire and ſoftly one towards the other. And now our men had ſhut and locked all the cabines, a certaine few excepted, for the hurt men to be carried into, and out of whome the ſcribes were to ſupply things neceſſarie. And that whileſt they were ſailing towards the battaile, they might repaire the ſtrength of their bodies, they diſtributed Bread, Wine, Chéeſe, and ſuch like victualls, vnto the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours, thoroughout euery Galley. But in the meane time, that the ſouldiours were at their victualls, the high Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Generall him ſelfe, <hi>Don Iohn</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> going a bord a Skiffe, accompanied with <hi>Don Iohn de Cardona,</hi> went ſpedely about all the whole Nauy, omitting no one thing that doth beſéeme a Prince and a valiant Generall. He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted both the Captaines of the Galleyes, and alſo all the reſt of the ſouldiours for to fight valiantly, for the name of Chriſt, for their Sauiour himſelfe would be preſent to help them, if they dyd the duetie of ſtout ſouldiours, and that he would giue them aſſured victorie: That this was the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly occaſion to reuenge ſo many iniuries receaued, and to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine immortall glorie.</p>
               <p>Whiles he ſpake thus, many aunſwered him couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly: that he ſhould not in any wiſe doubt of their prow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſe, for they were come thether for no other entent, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they would accompliſh the duetie of valiant men. This being done, he returned to his Galley Royall: neither was
<pb facs="tcp:15178:60"/>he him ſelfe alſo leſſe encouraged by the valour of <hi>Colonna</hi> and <hi>Venien,</hi> the Admiralls of the Hopes &amp; Venetian for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, then he himſelfe had before confirmed the reſt, with his owne proweſſe. For they being now armed, had ſo exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, prouided and commaunded, that they omitted nothing that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> make for the winning of ſo great a victorie. And now the Enſignes of all ſorts were aduanced in the maſts of euerie Galley, and in the high Admiral General Galley of <hi>Don Iohn</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> they hanged ſoorth the Enſigne of the Holie League, where were depainted the armes of the confederate Princes: &amp; that the heartes of all men might yet be more incenſed to proweſſe: they made a great noiſe &amp; ſigne of ioye with Drums, Trumpets, &amp; Fiftes &amp; other kinde of inſtruments, &amp; with a loude voice called vpon God Almightie, one in Trinitie. Alſo Prieſtes going from the puppe of the galley to the ſtem, did exhort all men with ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual words, to be valiant, for Chriſt himſelf would come downe from heauen, becauſe they fought for his name, and would be preſent himſelfe to help them all. By the which exhortations of the Prieſtes and Admiralls, all men were ſo thoroughly confirmed with concordious conſent, that they were readie to enter into, and to vndertake any daunger. But it was much more worthy of admiration, that at the very ſame moment, they that vntill that very inſtant had borne great hatred, and vſed extreme enimitie one to an other, were then mutinally reconciled one vnto other, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto they could neuer before be brought, neither by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of friends, nor by Magiſtrates for feare of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Such certes was the power and goodneſſe of God, that brought to paſſe that thoſe that perſecuted one an other before with deadly hatred, did now vppon a ſodaine forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all miuries, mutually embrace one an other.</p>
               <p>But ſuch was the nature of the place where the two fléetes did one happen on thother, that it threatned manifeſt daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger vnto them that would flye: both for that the fléetes were now to néere one an other, and alſo becauſe that gulfe of the ſea was nothing greater, for it was not in compaſſe
<pb facs="tcp:15178:60"/>round about aboue <hi>250.</hi> miles, and almoſt on euerie ſide in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed either with the maine land, or Ilands, the Sea that runneth betwéene them being ſcarſe twentie or fiue &amp; twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie miles broade. For on the North they had a part of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bania</hi> called <hi>Natalico,</hi> which reacheth from the Ile of Saint <hi>Maura</hi> to <hi>Lepanto, 80</hi> miles in length. On the Eaſt, was the coaſt of <hi>Morea,</hi> which lyeth out in length <hi>70.</hi> miles fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the entrance of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gulfe of <hi>Patras,</hi> to the <hi>Cape Torneſeo.</hi> On the South, they had the Ile of <hi>Zante,</hi> whoſe length is <hi>25.</hi> miles: &amp; on the Weſt <hi>Cefalenia,</hi> and the Ile of <hi>S. Maura,</hi> of whom thone is <hi>40.</hi> miles long, thother <hi>15.</hi> On the coaſt of <hi>Albania,</hi> almoſt a mite fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the maine, riſe vp the <hi>3.</hi> Rocks <hi>Cruzulari,</hi> differing in greatneſſe, but yet neither of them notorious great: they are from <hi>Lepanto 45.</hi> miles, from the Ile of <hi>S. Maura 35.</hi> from <hi>Cefalenia 70.</hi> and finally from <hi>Zante 80.</hi> miles. Now theſe rockes were to our men as they ſayled on the North, and they had <hi>Lepanto</hi> &amp; the Gulfe of <hi>Patras</hi> betwen the Eaſt &amp; North. Betwene the South &amp; the Eaſt, was a créeke of the ſea, that runneth in betwene <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea,</hi> and <hi>Zante 25.</hi> miles broade. They hadde betweene the South and the Weſt, the ſea that lyeth betwéene <hi>Cefale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> and <hi>Zante, 12.</hi> miles broade. The gulfe called <hi>Viſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do</hi> ſited to them on the Weſt, was but ſeuen miles broade. After that the two fléetes had thus on a ſodain, vnlooked for, deſcryed one the other, they could not auoyde the battaile. Wherefore when one about <hi>Don. Iohn</hi> ſaide, that it were good y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a conſultation were held before y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they deſcended to the fight: <hi>Don Iohn</hi> aunſ wered very wiſely, That now there was neither time nor place left for new counſailes and aduiſes, and that it was enough and enough againe, if that euerie man would by fighting valiantly, endeuour to execute y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which had bene before co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded in the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſaile. But our enimies had <hi>270.</hi> veſſells, of whom <hi>200.</hi> wer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Gallies, fiftie ſmal galleies, and twentie Foiſtes. But they had diſtributed all this Nauie into foure battailes, as alſo our men had done. And the middle battaile <hi>Ali</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ledde, and he had therein nintie Galleies.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:15178:61"/>
               <p>In the middeſt of whome he abiding, was garded on the right ſide with <hi>Portau Baſſa,</hi> and on the left with the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer of the Nauy: who did defenſe him on both ſides with eche of them thrée Admiralls. The right wing, which was oppoſed againſt our left, had fiftie Galleyes, and <hi>Mehemet Siroch,</hi> for Captaine. Their left wing, which came againſt our right, had <hi>90.</hi> Galleies vnder the conduct of <hi>Oluzali.</hi> In the battaile of ſuccour were not aboue ten gallies and <hi>20.</hi> Foiſtes. Being thus arranged, they came againſt our men, but yet otherwiſe affected in minde the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were, for <hi>Don Iohn, Colonna, Venieri,</hi> and the reſt of our Captaines, and voluntarie men, yea, and all the whole fléete, had with one conſent, determined to fight, and therefore they went foorth to méete with their enimies, not onely with entent to fight, but alſo with good hope to obteine the victorie. But the <hi>Turkiſh Baſſaes,</hi> with the reſt of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pyrates, and the whole Nauy went to méete our men with this minde, that they dyd aſſuredly think that they would flye, inſomuch that they meaſured the euent of the fight more by their owne light beléefe, and their former ſucceſſe, then by comparing of the powers: becauſe they could not learne in ſo ſhort a time the ſtrength of our holie league. Wherefore they were in trueth aſtonned when they comming néerer had ſéene that the power of our nauie was ſo great. But ſéeing there was now no time at all left for to conſult, and they ſaw that our men drew towards them couragiouſly, they alſo prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all things neceſſarie for fight. They aduaunced firſt very proude and rich Enſignes, and then after the maner of that nation, the reſt of the Galleies being almoſt filled full of other innumerable Enſignes, they vehemently inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all their men to fight valiantly, ſetting before them the fauour of the great Emperour, and the hope of an ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable priſe and bootie. And yet they had ſtill thought, that our men would flye, but when the néerer they came, the greater they found our mens forces to be: then they began to doubt of the matter, &amp; ſaw that they muſt néedes fight. But although this was ſo, yet the Captaines omitted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb facs="tcp:15178:61"/>that became valiant men. For ſéeing that they ſawe but onelie the right wing, ſhe middle battaile, and the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile of ſuccour, neither could yet ſée the left wing, becauſe it was hidden by the maine, they did not yet ſuppoſe the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of our men to be greater than <hi>Caracoza</hi> bad reported vnto them. But when they had within ſhort time after de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcried alſo all the lefte wing, and had ſéene the Galleazes verie happilie rowed forth with Dares, (a thing that they had thought impoſſible) they beganne to bée a little afraid. In our Nauie the Drums and the reſt, of the inſtruments played, and ſounded ſtill inceſſantlie, and all our whole fléete went forward in the forme of a croiſant, with their ranges verie well kept, and euerie Gallie was ſo farre one from another, that the Dares of the one dyd not let another: for the which conſideration, the rowers were forced to marke and obſerue exactlie the motion of their fellowes, that the order which had béene before appointed by the Captaines, might bée continuallie kept.</p>
               <p>And now the two nauies were not far from aſunder, when the maieſtie of God being wearie of the proſperous ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the moſt cruell tyrant, and taking compaſſion of the wrongfull and heauie oppreſſion of the Chriſtian common wealth, decréed at the length one daie to deliuer and extoll the name and honour of Chriſt our ſauiour, and dulie to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the tyrant. And he firſt beganne this thing, when hée did by a certaine meane beyond all mens expectation, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laie the winde that hetherto had blowen againſt our men, and ill for them, and made the Sea ſo quiet and calme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> that it might ſéeme to bée rather lande than water. This happened about the leauenth houre, and now the Nauye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> were almoſt vpon the verie point to ioyne together, when the Sunne that had paſſed the fore part of the Heauens, did with his beames ſtrike the enimies, who ſtoode Eaſtward: at which time a certaine lyght ſmall winde good for our men, beganne to blowe againe from the Weſt, in déede ſo greate, that it carried the miſts and ſmoakes from the ſight of our men vppon their enimies.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:15178:62"/>
               <p>Now a péece of Ordenances ſhot out of <hi>Ali</hi> his Admiral Galley, and anſ wered by two other ſhotte from the two wings, was a ſigne for to aſſaile our men with a mightie ſéeſe. So then they making an hideous crie mended theyr courſe, rowing towards our men a maine which béeing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcried by <hi>Venerio,</hi> he ſtrengthened his Gallie at the puppe with the verie well furniſhed Gallies of <hi>Iohn Loredano,</hi> and <hi>Catharino Malipetro.</hi> And <hi>Colonna</hi> did the like, calling two other vnto his defence: and now they were come ſo néere together, that one might reach another with their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denance, wherefore our ſixe Galeazes who went before all the reſt of the fléete, verie luſtilie aſſailed the enimie with continual thu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der of ſhot. And becauſe they neuer miſſed, they made ſuch a ſlaughter and ſpoile, that they layed the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt foundation of breaking the enimies, and the neerer they approched, the more miſchiefe they did them. In this terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtorme of the Ordenance, the enimies could not repaire themſelues, wherefore being ſtroken with feare, they kept not their cankes, yet they reſelued to goe forward with ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate hearts, that paſſing betwéene our Galeazes, who they thought had borne no Ordenance on their ſides, they might encloſe the reſt of our Nauie. And when they paſſed betwéen them, our men beganne to thunder vppon them ten times worſe: and did indomage them ſo much the more, as they were ſtaied and their courſe hindered by the wind that blew againſt them, for that being a litle augmented did let them, ſo that they could not ſoone paſſe beyond the ſtorme of migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie pellets, and alſo it carrying all the ſmoake vpon them, made them that they could ſée almoſt nothing, and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo gaue our men that ſhot their great Ordenance luſtelie out of the Galeazes, time for to recharge and ſhoote off their péeces againe, with whom almoſt the third part of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie was deſtroied and broken, not without the death of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men. So that now our men heard a mightie cracking and noiſe of the falling downe of Maſts and ſaile yardes, and of the Galleyes broken trauerſe and drowned, many Gallies were ſéene light in fire, and other ſtoode deſtitute of
<pb facs="tcp:15178:62"/>maiſters to guide the healme. Moreouer, there was ſéene an infinite number of men, oares, and ſaile yards, barrells, hogſheads, and all ſortes of weapons ſwimming in the ſea: &amp; therfore was this accident moſt worthie of wender, bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe ſixe Galeazes alone (the vſe of whom had neuer ben before found out in ſea fight) did make ſuch a ſlaughter and ſpoile of the enimies by turning themſelues round, and ſhooting now from the ſtem, then from the puppe and ſides. In this ſo great a checke, <hi>Mehemet Syroch</hi> that lead the right wing of the enimies, ſeuered himſelfe a little from the reſt of the fléete, that he might prouide for the ſafetie of his charge, and créeping cloſe to the ſhoare, came againſt our left wing. But that being eſpied by <hi>Auguſtine Barbarigo,</hi> he went forth to méete him, kéeping his ranges and araie moſt exactlie, and taking occaſion by the helpe of a certaine mountaine called <hi>Mahanguli,</hi> did ſo ſtoppe and ſhut vp his waie, that he could not paſſe by, no not with the leaſt of his veſſels.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Marino Contarini,</hi> the Nephew of <hi>Baibarigo,</hi> vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that ſo great a number of Gallyes ranne againſt his vnkle, made in, and impelled with too good a perſwaſion of his owne valour, and affinitie of bloud, rowed in before all the reſt of his fellowes: ſo that the great ordenance thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering on both ſides, a mightie fight was begunne in this place.</p>
               <p>The left wing of the enimies which <hi>Oluzali</hi> lead, and our right commanded by <hi>Doria,</hi> were almoſt ioyned ſoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but that both the Captaines being verie ſkilfull in ſea fight, did either expect ſome occaſion to be miniſtred to haue a faire hand, but by diuerſe and differing meanes. For <hi>Oluzali</hi> béeing readie both for fight and pollicie, obſerued which waie the victory enclined, but <hi>Doria</hi> becauſe he knew himſelfe farre inferiour in forces, for that <hi>Oluzali</hi> had nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Gallies, and he himſelfe but fiftie, held his enimies in ſuſpenſe as much as he could: for the which reaſon hee made out into the Sea, with certaine of his Gallyes,
<pb facs="tcp:15178:63"/>almoſt a mile from the reſt of his wing.</p>
               <p>In the middle battayle, <hi>Don Iohn, Colonna,</hi> and <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio,</hi> kéeping their ranges verie wel and cloſe, had with their battaile met with the middle battaile of their enimies: but yet before they came to hand ſtrokes, they had ſhot off their great ordenance twice or thrice, yea, and ſome of them fiue times, which was both a great terrour, &amp; alſo a detriment to the enimie: &amp; ſo much the more in truth, becauſe that many of their péeces woulde not goe off, by reaſon (as it was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes found) that our men had ſhot their Gunſtones into them: and againe, thoſe that woulde goe off, could lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle endomage our men, becauſe the deckes of our enimies Gallies were ſo much higher than ours, that although they did leuell their péeces a little downward, yet the ſhot dyd alwayes flie ouer our Gallyes. But notwithſtanding theſe incommodities, they lyke men in a rage, rowed in ſtill, and ioyned with our men, at which time there aroſe a mightie tempeſt of arrowes and ſmal ſhot, and all the whole ſea ſéemed to burne, by reaſon of ſo many arteficiall fires caſt on the one ſide and the other by diuerſe engines. And now in ſome places, foure Gallies encountered with thrée, and ſire with foure, and in other alſo ſixe with one, and one leaping into the other Gallies, made a great ſlaughter with ſwords, daggers, kniues, battleaxes, arowes, wild fire, and other ſhort weapons: and alſo when many woulde for diuerſe cauſes retire themſelues, they were hurledhead long into the Sea, the which was thereby now become as redde as bloud.</p>
               <p>In the meane time <hi>Syroch</hi> had in the right wing of the enimie felte the force of our valyant men of the lefte wing, and ſawe that hée coulde not effect that which hée hadde thought to haue done, becauſe hée beheld his Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyes to lie broken, their Saile yardes, and Maſts fallen downe, and other things caried vp into the ayre by the ſhot of our great Ordenaunce.</p>
               <p>Wherefore he endeauoured to his vttermoſt, to kéepe his men in their duetie, but yet for all that euer he coulde
<pb facs="tcp:15178:63"/>doe, many of his galleies at length coueting to eſcape out of ſo great a ſlaughter and garboile, and to ſaue themſelues, ranne headlong for haſt on the ſhore: after which miſchance moſt leaped into the Sea, that they might eſcape into the maine by ſwimming, but many being wounded, and many vnſkilfull of ſwimming, or elſe hindered and impeached by ſome other meanes, ſtayed ſtill becauſe they had ſome hope in the clemencie of the Chriſtians, that they would ſaue their liues. At the which place this olde manner of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Turks, which is now plainly become a cuſtome, is worthie of noting. For at the beginning of an encounter they doe ſhew ſingular fierceneſſe, with a moſt vehement féeſe: but a little while after, when they doe perceue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they are ſtoutly reſiſted, they caſting away courage, betake them to flight. And certes, at this time they could not hope for helpe of their infinit number of footemen and horſemen, as they are wont in battailes by land. Wherefore when they could not withſtand the valour of the Chriſtians, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing entred their gallies, ſlew all they founde, they within ſhort time forſooke their Gallies, and ranne away: at the which time the Chriſtians that had bene before priſoners in the Turkiſh Gallies, perceiuing that now they were come into the hands of our men, taking the Turkes their owne weapons, brake of their chaines and manackles, and valiantly reuenged the crueltie of the tyrannie which they had ſuffered vntill that inſtant. <hi>Marke Quirmi,</hi> and <hi>Antony Canali,</hi> who were in this ſame wing, but in an other part, made out, but yet they could not ſo ſoone ſhut in this wing of thenimies, but that they had firſt all leaped into the ſea. Yet all the galleies were taken by our men, and thoſe that were left in them were all ſlaine, for to reuenge their cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. But of our Captaines there died in this left wing <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rino Contarini, Vincent Quirini,</hi> and <hi>Andrew Babarigo.</hi> But <hi>Auguſtine Barbarigo</hi> being ſhot into the eye with an arrow, receaued a deadly wound, the which did incontinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bereaue him of his ſpeach, of whoſe death we wil ſpeake hereafter. Alſo <hi>Marke Antony Ciconia,</hi> was very ſore hurt
<pb facs="tcp:15178:64"/>with wilde fire.</p>
               <p>In the middle battaile <hi>Don Iohn de Auſtria</hi> encounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with <hi>Ali</hi> himſelfe, and two other Captaines that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Admirall Gallies. And <hi>Ali</hi> had in his Admirall Galley thrée hundred Ianizars, with harquebuſſes, and an hundreth with croſſebowes, who fought all verie valiantly both with ſhot and ſwordes. And againe with <hi>Don Iohn</hi> were foure hundred choſen harquebuziers of <hi>Sardinia,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the conduct of <hi>Lopes de Figheroa</hi> campe maiſter, and many other Gentlemen and valiant men beſides, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fought with great proweſſe. <hi>Colonna</hi> plied with might and paine to laie a boord the Galley that encountered him, and was vehementlie ſtirred vp thereto, becauſe he ſawe a mightie ſlaughter of his enimies committed by his fellowes before his face. Neither did alſo <hi>Veneiro</hi> leſſe execute the dutie of a good Admirall, for that his Gallie was to fight with thrée principall Captaines of the enimies, and ſeauen Admirall Gallies, to whoſe ſuccour alſo did other euer and anone come. But in the meane time when the great Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of <hi>Meſsina,</hi> ſawe that our thrée high Admiralls were to fight with ſuch a great number of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enimies, he taking with him the Gallies of <hi>Loredano</hi> and <hi>Malipetro,</hi> went thether with a great ſpéed and valour, and thruſting into the middeſt of the troupe, committed a great ſlaughter. But <hi>Loredano</hi> &amp; <hi>Malipetro</hi> entering into the thickeſt of the fight, like valy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant men, were ſtraight waie ſlaine with the ordenance: but the reſt that were in their Gallies were ſo farre from béeing diſmaide with their death, that they rather hauing encreaſed their courage, and after a ſort, their ſtrength, with deſire of reuenge and anger, began to fight ten times more fiercelie: ſo that within ſhort time they had taken two Gallies of the enimies, and ſo many had <hi>Veniero</hi> and <hi>Colonna</hi> ouercome, that fought with them. And almoſt at the verie ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>Don Iohn</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> who vntill now had borne the charge and force of fiue Gallies, and had, conquered thrée of them, did take the Admirall royall of <hi>Ali,</hi> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had ſlain, but had beene before beaten thrice out of her with greate
<pb facs="tcp:15178:64"/>ſlaughter, after that he was come as farre as the maſt. So then whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>n <hi>Ali</hi> was ſlaine our men ioyfullie cried, victorie, victorie, for although then had done the like before, yet it was then doubtfull, becauſe both ſides yet fought moſt eagerlie, and verie great ſpoile and ſlaughter was yet committed on both ſides. But now the enimies reſiſted our men no more, ſo that they did acknowledge them for victors: wherefore our men were now buſied in gathering together the pillage, and rather in binding than killing the enimies. And now a verie great number of principall men had ben either taken or ſlaine by our men, but almoſt an infinite number of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizars and other ſouldiours, inſomuch that they onelie eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, that foreſéeing the entire deſtruction of their fléet by the pittifull ſpoile that the Galeazes made, had fled awaie at the verie beginning of the battaile in ſkiffes and other ſmall veſſels, as <hi>Portau Baſſa</hi> did: who ſtraight after the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the fight, ſtale awaie priuitie into the maine in a ſmall veſſell, and ſaued himſelfe by flight. There died alſo of our Captaines in this middle battaile <hi>Iohn Loredano, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therino Malipetro, Hierome Veniero, Fances Bono, Iohn Baptiſta Benedicto a Cypriot,</hi> and Iames <hi>Treſino</hi> of <hi>Vicen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za,</hi> and ther were wounded, <hi>Iohn Bembo, Theodore Balbi,</hi> the Prior of <hi>Meſsina,</hi> and many other noble men &amp; knights.</p>
               <p>In the left wing of the enimie, when <hi>Oluzali</hi> vnderſtood that his fellowes were diſcomfited, and perceiued that hée might be aſſailed &amp; broken by <hi>Doria,</hi> who did now acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the happie euent of this battaile, began diligentlie to conſider what meanes he might make to ſaue himſelfe. Wherefore ſéeing certaine of the Gallies of our ryght wing diuided and ſeparated from the reſt, hée taking holde of that occaſion, valiantlie charged them. But cur men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued them verie couragiouſlie, truſting not ſo much to their own ſtrength, as they aſſuredly hoped for ſpéedie ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour from their fellowes. But <hi>Doria,</hi> who I tolde you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had made out into the Sea with a parte of his wing, that hée might ſuſpende <hi>Oluzali</hi> from fight,) was too farre off for to come to ſuccour them preſentlie: but
<pb facs="tcp:15178:65"/>he had prudently fet a compaſſe as farre as the Galleaze of <hi>Pitano,</hi> that he might aſſaile <hi>Oluzalion</hi> the back. But when <hi>Oluzah</hi> had perceaued him, &amp; ſaw that he prepared to come againſt him with many of his owne Galleies, and other of the left wing, he paſſingly plagued theſe fewe that he had aſſailed, and ſodainly flying vp into the ſea, fled away with many of his Gallies. But he had alſo taken of our Gallies, and being tied to his gallies, had dragged after him, the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of <hi>Peter Bua</hi> of <hi>Corfu,</hi> of the Prior of <hi>Meſsina,</hi> and of <hi>Lewes Cipico</hi> of <hi>Trau.</hi> In this forious and fierce conflict, <hi>Benedict Soranzo,</hi> although he had receaued thrée wounds in his face, yet he fought moſt valiantly, &amp; with a few men defended his galley a good long while, vntill that the forces of the enimies being mightely augmented, they tooke away from him with his Galley his life alſo, for a ſacrifice vnto Chriſt: Neither yet was his death vnreuenged, for when the enimies were entred into the Galley, there was a fire kindled in the munitions, wherewith the Galley was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, and the enimies caſt into the aire. There dyed here alſo beſides <hi>Soranzo, Hierome Contarini, Marke Antony Lando, Marke Antony Paſqualigo, Iames Medi, George Corneli</hi> and <hi>Peter Bua.</hi> But among them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were grieuoſly hurt, was <hi>Lewes Cypico</hi> of <hi>Trau.</hi> For after he had fought valiantly, and had but onely ſixe men left him, and had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaned ſeuen very great wounds, he being at the laſt van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed, was carried away with his galley. But he and the Prior of <hi>Meſsina,</hi> were ſoone ſuccoured, and reſcued, &amp; their Gallies taken away from <hi>Oluzali,</hi> who had towed them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, as taken priſoners, and they themſelues were brought backe againe aliue.</p>
               <p>In this encounter with <hi>Oluzali,</hi> there were much enda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maged beſides theſe, a galley of <hi>Sauoy,</hi> an other of <hi>Florence,</hi> and a third of <hi>Spaine:</hi> and although both in this wing, and alſo in other places, many of our men had bene grieuouſly hurt and ſtaine, yet ſo great was their valour, that with the aide of Gods goodneſſe, they loſt not one galley, but that of <hi>Peter Bua</hi> of <hi>Corfu,</hi> which was carryed away by the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
<pb facs="tcp:15178:65"/>And now at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

But they could not purſue <hi>Oluzali,</hi> becauſe it was almoſt night, and alſo for that he beeing got vp into the maine Sea was ſaid to bée gone too farre for to bée recouered.</p>
               <p>But this now was a moſt memorable and horrible ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle, that all the ſea was ſéene red of bloud, and almoſt an infinite number of dead carcaſes were ſéene ſwimming therein, and a wonderfull number of cries were heard of the wounded and ſwimming men, as well of the one ſide as the other, calling for helpe: yea, and oftentimes our men and the enimies would at one time take holde of one péece of woode, ſéeking thereby to ſaue themſelues, with ſuch ſhri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, roaring, and pittifull cries euerie where, as woulde haue amazed a man, and all theſe thinges ſeemed to bée ſo much the greater and more pittifull, as the aire waxed darker by the approach of night.</p>
               <p>After that the Fléete of <hi>Oluzali</hi> was now come into our mens handes, they fell to getting and gathering toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the priſe and pillage: and therein they ſpent that little of the daie that was lefte, and at euening went mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilie with the Ottomanicall ſpoiles into certaine Hauens called <hi>Petalici.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this was the ſucceſſe of this battaile by Sea, which doubtleſſe was very great: for ſince <hi>Auguſtus</hi> his time, ther was not ſo great a battaile fought by Sea. And this victorie of ours ought to be eſteemed the more worthie of admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe it befell vnto vs néere to that place where <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus Caeſar</hi> did long before diſcomfite <hi>Marke Antonie</hi> at the foreland of <hi>Actium,</hi> where now <hi>Preueſa</hi> is. Neither doth it alſo leſſe make for the augmentation of the renowme of this famous victorie, that although they fought but onelie foure houres, yet they trode to péeces the head of that great Serpent of the Eaſt, and brake the ſtrength of <hi>Selim,</hi> that moſt mightie tyrant.</p>
               <p>The firſt houre of the night after all our whole Nauie
<pb facs="tcp:15178:66"/>was brought into the Hauen through the ſingular induſtrie of our Captaines, there ſodainlie aroſe ſo great a wind, and ſo great a tempeſt, that the inhabitants of that place did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that they neuer in all their liues felte the like. But our men lying ther ſafelie, wer ſo careful for the healing of the ſicke and wounded, that the Captaines did take them into their owne cabines.</p>
               <p>Now to grow to an end, ſingular was the wiſedome and diligence of our thrée high Admiralls, <hi>Don Iohn de Auſtria, Marke Antonie de Colonna,</hi> and <hi>Sebaſtiano Venieri,</hi> in learning out the ſtate and intent of the enimie, and alſo their induſtrie in ſage conſulting and diſcréete appointing what ſhould be done: and then again, no leſſe praiſe worthie was the dexteritie and readineſſe of the reſt of the Captaines in the executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And in perticular, the Marques <hi>de Santa Cruz,</hi> that lead the battaile of ſuccour, ſhewed rare prudence in ſending of ſuccour with ſingular ſpéed vnto thoſe that were oppreſſed by the enimie: and finallie, wonderfull was the valour of the common Souldiours in the action and fight. And to conclude, all that were there preſent at this bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, and fought for the name of Chriſt their ſauiour, if they bée aliue, may glorie that they were pertakers of this ſo great a victorie: but if they loſt their liues there, they doe inioy the reſt of the bleſſed, and hauing exchanged this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall life for immortall, doe poſſeſſe the true fruite of the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie: the which may bée a great comfort to their parents and kinſfolke. For ſéeing that we doe knowe that no man can be borne immortall of mortall parents, the onelie waie to obtaine immortall life, is to get glorie and praiſe by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and valour.

But although he had a great number of them, as well lawfull as baſtards, yet we will ſpeake in this place onely of them, which were cauſe of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and ſtirres in this kingdome, who were in number foure.

But when the Moores did alſo aſſaile them there, and the Turkes perceiued that they laboured in vain to ſaue themſelues, and namelie, ſéeing now their victualls began to faile them: they ſet fire to ſeuen barrells of Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouder, that they had ſet round about them, choſing rather to deſtroie themſelues by furious fire, than to come into the hands of the Moores their enimies.</p>
               <p>But the kings armie was alſo conſtrained to returne to <hi>Marocco,</hi> where the Prince <hi>Muley Abdallas</hi> (although that he was then in the Citie of <hi>Fes</hi>) was agayne proclaimed king. But he, as ſoone as he heard of his Fathers death, went forth of <hi>Fes,</hi> and when he bare him as king, there was none of the prouinces y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> did not willinglie and gladly receiue him. Wherevpon within few dayes after, he gathered a mightie armie of many Nations (who offered him their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice) with the which hée marching to <hi>Marocco,</hi> was recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of the Citizens with ſurpaſſing ioy, honour, and gratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. For whileſt his Father was yet liuing, he had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the ſingular fauour and good will of his ſubiects, and found it alſo after his death: becauſe as long as he liued, he ſought for nothing elſe but golden peace, and the quietneſſe of his ſubiects, and to kéepe them happie and bleſſed, without anie harme. Whereby he gathered together ſo great riches and treaſure, as ſcarce anie king that euer liued before him had gotten. So <hi>Abdallas</hi> raigned alone certaine yéeres, and kept his Court by turnes, one yere at <hi>Feſſe,</hi> and two at <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocco,</hi> vntill ſuch time as hée made an heire apparant, and inſtituted a ſucceſſor.</p>
               <p>After <hi>Abdallas</hi> had raigned long time in ſingular quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and had alone vſed &amp; exerciſed the ſupreame rule &amp; go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, he determined with himſelf to abrogate &amp; diſanul the law, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> his Father with the péeres of the kingdome had made, for the ſucceſſion in the crowne: which ſhould in order ſtill deſcend alwaies to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> elder brother liuing. And although that <hi>Abdallas</hi> did priuelie &amp; ſecretlie practiſe it, with thoſe in whom he repoſed greateſt truſt, yet notwithſtanding the
<pb facs="tcp:15178:70"/>matter came at length to the notice of his brothers: of whom ſome béeing carefull of their liues, and fearing to bée made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie by ſome trecherie, fled out of the kingdome, as <hi>Abdel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munen</hi> and <hi>Abdelmelec,</hi> who not without paſſing great pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill (becauſe there were many priuie awaites laide for them in their iourney by the ſeruants of their brother <hi>Abdallas</hi>) fledde to <hi>Tremiſsen.</hi> And béeing there, they were cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſlie entertained by the Turkes, as young Gentlemen of the bloud rotall. And anone after they withdrew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to <hi>Argier,</hi> that they might liue more ſafelte there, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the defence of the Turkiſh Emperour. When <hi>Muley Abdallas,</hi> who as we told you before, priuelie compaſſed the murther of his brothers, that hée might ſafelie leaue the kingdome to his ſonnes, heard that they ſought to ſaue them ſelues by flying out of the Countrie, hée diſſembling his anger (for it greeued him at the heart that ſome of them had eſcaped) leaſt the reſt of his brothers ſhould bée alſo afraide, gathered together all his forces out of hand, vnder pretence of going to the Citie of <hi>Fes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore being firſt encamped before the Citie of <hi>Marocco,</hi> and anone after his Campe remooued, as though he woulde goe to <hi>Fes:</hi> When he heard that his Brothers were come to ſalute him, hee leauing his youngeſt brother (whoſe childiſh yéeres hée contemned) ſtaied for them feare daies iourney from the Citie of <hi>Fes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So then when they were come together, and hadde ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted one another, it happened that a littie while after, they ſuſpecting no ill, nor fearing anie falſchoode, were with monſtrous crueltie all thrée beheaded in their Tentes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The which thing dyd not pricke the kinges ſubiectes a little at the heart, but déepelie pearced it, yet they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to diſſemble their ſorrow.</p>
               <p>After that hée had done this ſo Tragicall an act, hée fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed his iourney to <hi>Fes,</hi> to the intent for to thruſt his ſonne <hi>Muley Mahomet</hi> vpon the Feſſans for their Prince and ſole heir of all his kingdomes, &amp; ſo force them to ſweare faith &amp; obedience vnto him.

                  <pb facs="tcp:15178:71"/>and in déede more worthie of the Empire, yet becauſe this was his eldeſt, and alſo for other cauſes, he ratheſt made choice of him to be his ſucceſſour. Wherfore as ſoone as hée came to <hi>Fes,</hi> he aſſembling the States, brought the matter to that paſſe, that they gaue their allegeance to his ſonne, &amp; ſware to be true liegemen vnto him, rather conſtrained by feare, than brought to it by loue and good will towards the Prince, or for anie right that he could pretend to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. After he had diſpatched theſe matters, and ſéeing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> al things had ſuccéeded as he did wiſh: then, that he, who was now almoſt broken with age, might paſſe the reſt of his life in quiet idleneſſe, he returned with his armie to <hi>Marocco,</hi> leaning his ſonne in the Citie of <hi>Fes</hi> for to gouerne that Prouince.</p>
               <p>Things ſtanding in this ſtate in <hi>Barbarie,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> two brothers got then to <hi>Argier,</hi> for to eſcape and auoide the furie of their brother <hi>Muley Abdallas,</hi> and the younger of them, <hi>Muley Abdelmelec</hi> went to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> Where he did ſerue ſo well both by ſea and by land, that for his noble courage of heart, and paſſing ſtrength of bodie, he allured many men to his loue, &amp; through his valiant acts and victories gotten of his enimies, he wan the fame of a great name, not onelie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people, but alſo with the Prince of the Turkes himſelfe.

And ſtraightway he had ready to take the field, fiue thouſand harquebuziers, as well <hi>Turkes,</hi> as <hi>Azuagas,</hi> warlike men and well practiſed in feates of armes.

When he came to <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſen,</hi> he was very honorably receaued, and there ſtayed ſixe dayes for to make prouiſion of all things neceſſarie for the warres, and he with his younger brother <hi>Hamet,</hi> whom he ſound there, leuied twelue thouſand ſpeares, and foure hundreth Harquebuſſiers on horſebacke, and toke with him out of <hi>Tremiſſen,</hi> twelue field pieces, with victualls, and all other munition. Being furniſhed with theſe forces, he marched to take the Citie of <hi>Fes.</hi> But although <hi>Muley Mahamet,</hi> (who was that time at <hi>Marocco</hi>) was certified of the enterpriſe of his vnkle, yet he did ſo contemne him, and did ſo deſpiſe his forces in compariſon of his owne, that he tooke no regard thereof, vntill he ſaw that the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was come to good earneſt in déede, and that he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode that <hi>Abdelmelec</hi> hadde now aſſembled his forces at <hi>Tremiſſen.</hi> And then he leuying men in haſt, and in a hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, without choiſe, encamped a league or two miles from <hi>Marocco,</hi> and commaunded all the ſubiects of his kingdoms to repaire vnto him, ſpredding a rumor that he would aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile the Chriſtians of <hi>Tangar,</hi> that by this allurement they might take armes more chéerefully, becauſe the <hi>Moores</hi> doe deſire no warres more, than thoſe that are kept againſt the Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>Theſe forces being made readie, and furniſhed with
<pb facs="tcp:15178:72"/>great Artillerie, he commaunded them to march towards <hi>Feſſe,</hi> and becauſe the greateſt part of his power had ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with him in his iourney, as ſoone as he came to <hi>Feſſe,</hi> he muſtered his armie, which then conſiſted of foure ſcore thouſande horſemen with ſpeare and ſhield, thirtene thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand footemen, harquebuziers, and foure thouſand harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buziers on horſeback, with ſixe and thirtie field péeces. At the ſame moment that <hi>Mahamet</hi> did ſet foorth with his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie againſt <hi>Abdelmelec,</hi> there came vnto him a noble man Ambaſſadour from <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> the King of <hi>Portugall,</hi> who promiſed him in his maſters Maieſties name, aide againſt the <hi>Turkes,</hi> and his Vnkle. But <hi>Mahamet</hi> being made more proude for that he ſaw ſo great an armie and ſo ſtrong vnder his commaund, contemned the benefit of the king of <hi>Portugall.</hi> Wherefore as ſoone as he vnderſtoode that his vnkle was departed from <hi>Tremiſſen,</hi> he marched againſt him with that heate, that theyr Armies mette betweene <hi>Feſſe,</hi> and <hi>Tremiſſen,</hi> the ſeuententh of March, in Au. <hi>1576.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Battaile was begonne about euening, and the furious tempeſt continued ſo long, vntill that <hi>Mahamets</hi> armie being wearied both in heart and bodie, turned their backes. The fault of that flight was aſcribed to one <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall,</hi> who being Captaine of the <hi>Andalouſians,</hi> reuolted from <hi>Mahamet</hi> to <hi>Abdelmelec,</hi> with two thouſande verie choice harquebuziers.

               <p>So <hi>Abdelmelec</hi> got the victorie, without much ſweete or bloud, on either ſide, and doubtleſſe <hi>Mahamet,</hi> might

But <hi>Abdelmelec</hi> hauing obtained ſo famous a victorie, ſent a good great troupe for to purſue and take <hi>Mahamet,</hi> but he himſelfe béeing receiued with great ioy of the <hi>Feſſans,</hi> was proclaimed king by them, and the reſt of the Cities and Townes of that kingdome. And becauſe he hauing caught an ague was not well in health, he determined to reſt a litle while in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Citie of <hi>Fes,</hi> &amp; there diſmiſſed the Turkiſh forces which came with him vnder the leading of <hi>Rabadan Baſſa,</hi> to the king of <hi>Argier.</hi> For that <hi>Baſſa</hi> had no more in his commiſſion but to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie <hi>Abdelmelec</hi> to <hi>Feſſe,</hi> and to put him in poſſeſſion of that kingdome.

               <p>But that we may returne to <hi>Muley Mahamet:</hi> as ſoone as he came to <hi>Marocco</hi> he repaired his power, he leuied ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours in all parts of the kingdome, he opening his Cofers monyed the Captaines, rewarded the ſouldiours, and went about more diligentlie to winne all mennes good will with giftes, than euer he had done in his life before, hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard and reſpect of this onelle, that he might waſh out with ſome notable victorie, the ſhamefull blot that his vnkle had giuen him, and to make amends therefore. So by this care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe and diligence, he got together ten thouſand harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buziers ſcotemen, and a thouſand on horſebacke, but freſh water ſouldiours, and beſides them thirtie thouſand horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with ſpeare and ſhéelde. The which forces, with foure and twentie field péeces, he brought into the field, and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſo much victuals as was néedfull for that iourney. But if happened that alſo at this ſecond muſter the king of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> ſent againe an Ambaſſador vnto him, with Letters, &amp; againe offred him aide againſt <hi>Abdelmelec</hi> his vnkle. But he made the verie ſame anſwere to the ſecond Ambaſſador that he did to the firſt: but that he muſtering all his whole

               <p>When <hi>Abdelmelec</hi> had a little recouered himſelfe of his fickneſſe at <hi>Feſſe,</hi> and had augmented his armie with ſixe thouſand harquebuziers, after the departure of the Turkes, (whereof we tolde you before) he lead forth his armie with purpoſe to march toward <hi>Maroccco,</hi> for he had heard that <hi>Mahamet</hi> was in the field with a mightie armie. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he began to be now a little better, he being carried in an horſe litter marched towards <hi>Marocco</hi> with ſixe thouſand harquebuziers, twentie thouſand horſemen with ſpeare and ſhéeld, two thouſand argolets, with twentie field péeces. On the other ſide <hi>Mahamet</hi> being aduertiſed of his vnkles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, went verie ſpéedelie out of <hi>Marocco</hi> with great haſt, and heate to fight, and to trie the right of a kingdome with the perill of his life.

               <p>The victours in this laſt battaile ſlue aboue ſixe thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand.

               <p>
                  <hi>Mahamet</hi> ſéeking ſafetie by flight, came to <hi>Marocco,</hi> not without the greate infamie of his men, followed by a ſixe or eight ſpeares, and then going into the plaine, hée tooke out as much treaſure as could bée commodiouſlie carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie, and laide it on fiue Mules, &amp; ſtaying in the Citie not aboue two houres, betooke him againe to flight, haſting to eſcape his vnkles troupes that were not farre off. Béeing thus departed out of the Citie with a few horſe men, he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted a fling on the ſpurre towards Mount <hi>Atlas</hi> (now <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio</hi>) which béeing ſixe leagues from <hi>Marocco,</hi> is the ſanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and refuge of proſcribed and baniſhed men and théeues. But leauing <hi>Mahamet</hi> in the mountaines of <hi>Clario,</hi> let vs returne vnto <hi>Abdelmelec.</hi> He as ſoone as he had gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the ſpoiles of the vanquiſhed enimies, marched with all his armie to <hi>Marocco,</hi> and being ariued there the eight daie after the victorie, was receiued with ſo great pompe &amp; ioy, as neuer was ſéene before in thoſe Countries, for he had gotten a great fame, to bée a good, curteous, affable, and pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull man towards thoſe in calamitie, and was alſo verie well furniſhed with many other vertues: Then againe, the inſolencie and tyrannie of <hi>Muley Hamet,</hi> made <hi>Abdelme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lec</hi> the more gratious &amp; better beloued of all men. As ſoone as he was entered into the Citie (which was the xv. of Iulie, in the ſame yéere) he began to ſet in order the politike ſtate of the kingdome, that he might ſhew himſelfe to be not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie valiant in armes, and the field, but alſo ſingular in wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome for framing of a publike weale. For he abrogated ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny lawes &amp; ſtatutes, made by his anceſtors, he vſed paſſing great curteſie and gentleneſſe towards his ſubiects, he alſo gaue great gifts and largeſſe, &amp; diuided victuals among the people: applying all his actions to this end, that he might by
<pb facs="tcp:15178:74"/>theſe meanes extend his ſame, and get himſelfe immortall glorie aboue all the kings of <hi>Africa,</hi> that went before him. Although at the firſt he was nothing gratious, ſpeciallie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that the people were offended with the vnreaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and vnrulineſſe of the Turkes, that he had with him, becauſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they (as they are proud, vnrulie, intollerable, and lawleſſe) did verie licentiouſlie oppreſſe the poore Moores w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> many grieuous iniuries &amp; violences: but the king did ſoone rid the Countrie of them, ſending them awaie by little and little, and by two and by thrée at a time, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> at the length there remained not aboue <hi>200.</hi> whome yet he kept from his companie &amp; ſight, and being brought into order, conſtrained them to liue quietlie, &amp; without doing harme. The which thing made his ſubiects to turne their loue towards him, and they bing moued with the onlie fame of his vertue, did offer themſelues vnto him moſt humbly, &amp; promiſed him due obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, &amp; finallie, they with liberall and bountifull mindes brought him a vie great, rich, and honourable gifts and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, out of all partes and prouinces. There were alſo not a few Chriſtian Princes, that did take ſingular ioy of his friendſhip: and he alſo on the other ſide receiued them into his friendſhip with a moſt louing heart, &amp; did thinke himſelf flouriſhing in their familiaritie &amp; fauour to be a happie and bleſſed man: inſomuch y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> many Chriſtians did continually &amp; out of all quarters repaire vnto his kingdome, whom he did more loue, &amp; made more of, than he did of any other kind of men y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vſed to come into his countries. For he gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny &amp; great beneuolences, &amp; vſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with wonderful curteſie &amp; gentleneſſe, he alſo diſmiſſed many frée without ranſome, gratis, of an vnwonted benificence. But I will not dwell long vpon this his liberalitie &amp; magnificence, namely, ſeeing that his noble workes are verie well knowen to the whole worlde, through the publike reporte of fame. But after he hadde obtained the roiall throne, the firſt thing he did, was to appoint who ſhoulde ſuccéede him in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and to confirme the lawe made by <hi>Muley Maha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met Xeque</hi> his Father: and therefore hée ſwore all the
<pb facs="tcp:15178:75"/>péeres of the kingdome vnto his brother <hi>Muley Hamet,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that he himſelfe had a ſonne, but yet of tender age, whom he might haue nominated to be his ſucceſſour. The which thing, although it held the nobilitie in ſuſpence with admiration, yet incontinentlie incredible feaſts &amp; triumphs were kept in honour of the new Prince, and memorie of the olde law, and alſo the memorie of his granfather <hi>Xarif</hi> was honourablie mentioned &amp; renued by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> péeres. In the meane time <hi>Muley Mahamet,</hi> who had gotten him to the ſtreights of mount <hi>Clario,</hi> beganne ſtraight waie to gather together ſome ſouldiours, and among them ſome outlawes &amp; théeues: inſomuch that he had gathered together fiue hundred har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuziers, and two hundreth horſe men with ſhéelde and Speare.</p>
               <p>Being furniſhed with which bands, he beganne to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit robberies, he ſpoiled thoſe that he met, and ſacked the villages, and places that laie vnder mount <hi>Clario,</hi> and forced their inhabitants for to acknowledge him for their Lorde, and to paie him tribute, as to their king. Theſe robberyes and roades he vſed the ſpace of ſeauen or eight moneths, ſo that <hi>Abdelmelec</hi> was forced to leuie forces for to coole his luſtineſſe, &amp; to driue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> théeues out of the dens of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. For the doing of the which exploit, he vſed the ſeruice of the new prince <hi>Muley Hamet,</hi> who was with a power in the kingdome of <hi>Sus,</hi> for to make excurſions. He diſcomfited <hi>Muley Mahamet</hi> in certaine places, and almoſt wholie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroied all his band as wel footemen and horſemen, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him to hide himſelfe in the verie thicke woodes, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceſſible cragges of the mountaine, where hée lurked aboue a yéere, almoſt killed with colde, ſnowe, and other miſeries, and the inclemencie of the aire, and moſt miſerablie mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted and beaten with deſpaire of his lyfe, and feare of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waites, which his Vnkle layde for him, propoſing greate rewards to him that could bring him eyther dead or aliue. At length he was driuen by neceſſitie, (the ſharpeſt wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon) to that which hée hadde before refuſed, and tooke ſcorne off: that is, to deſire the aide of the Kinge of
<pb facs="tcp:15178:75"/>
                  <hi>Portugall,</hi> for to deliuer him from the awaites, and hands of his vnkle, and to reſtore him vnto his graund fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and fathers kingedome. For the which cauſe he ſent a meſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger from <hi>Mount Clario,</hi> with letters vnto the king of <hi>Portugall,</hi> and willed him to goe by <hi>Mazaga.</hi> But that he might receaue ſome aunſwere more ſafely &amp; ſpeadely, he reſolued to leaue the mountaines, and to get him to <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar.</hi> So through the woodes and wilderneſſes of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, where the way was very ſafe, and not beaten with tract of mens féete, he came without any great daunger vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Penon:</hi> where after he had ſtayed a few dayes to gather his men together, he went towards <hi>Tangar,</hi> where he was courteouſly receaued into the Citie, by the Gouernour, but leauing his forces without the walles. From that Citie he ſent two of his Captaines in Ambaſſade with letters, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with two gentlemen of <hi>Tangar,</hi> vnto king <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſtian,</hi> and deſired of him aide for to reſtore him vnto his Fathers kingdome. And becauſe the gouernour of <hi>Tangar</hi> was not ignorant, that if he vſed the king of <hi>Marocco</hi> cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly, that he ſhould thereby well pleaſe the king of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugall,</hi> he diſpatched a Carauell to <hi>Lisbon</hi> with the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours for their ſpéedier paſſage, of whoſe iourney and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, we wil ſpeake, after that we haue firſt admoniſhed the reader of certaine things neceſſarie to be knowen.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> being by nature verie much giuen to loue of armes, ſought for no other pleaſure then by marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all matters, which had cauſed him in former yéeres to paſſe ouer to <hi>Tangar,</hi> to thentent to conquere <hi>Barbarie,</hi> but with vaine endeuour. For <hi>Mahamet,</hi> (as we haue tould you before) had of a vaine and fooliſh confidence, twiſe refuſed aides offered him by the <hi>Portugall.</hi> But when the king of <hi>Portugall</hi> ſaw that now his ayde was deſired by the letters of the king of <hi>Marocco,</hi> he was very glad that a moſt wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed occaſion whereby he might fill his long luſt and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was offered vnto him, who was deſirous of praiſe, and ſtudious to enlarge his Empire, and Religion. Wherefore he receued magnificently the Ambaſſadour of <hi>Muly Maha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:15178:76"/>being ariued in <hi>Portugall,</hi> and graunted them their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt in all demaunds, and alſo wrote letters to <hi>Mahamet,</hi> wherein he promiſed his trauaile, helpe, and fauour, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring him into his fathers kingdome, no man of his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeile, or of the nobilitie holding much againſt it. And this might be the cauſe of that interview, where the Catholick king, and the king of Portugall met and talked together, in An. <hi>1578.</hi> at <hi>Guadalupea,</hi> a citie of <hi>Caſtilia.</hi> Where the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke king laboured all that he could, to feare the king of <hi>Portugall</hi> from that enterpriſe: or if he would néedes goe through with it, nor could not be diſuaded fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his purpoſe, that then he would doe it very ſubſtantially, and effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, prouiding and furniſhing himſelfe paſſing well with all things néedefull for ſo great an attempt. But when the King of Portugall continued conſtant in that he had once purpoſed, he returned home: whither anone after the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike king ſent his Ambaſſadours for to deale with him about the ſame matter that he himſelfe had talked with him off in preſence. For the Catholick king was not ignorant, how the king of <hi>Marocco</hi> did ſurpaſſe in ſtrength &amp; power, &amp; how ſkilful, expert, &amp; valiant a warriour he was, and how great power and prouiſion, ſo great an enterpriſe required, wherof he knew that the <hi>Portugall</hi> was yet fully vnfurni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. But y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king of <hi>Portugal</hi> remained conſtant in his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, &amp; began to prouide all things neceſſarie for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> voiage. Firſt he made leuies of ſouldious throughout his own king<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dome, he ſent ſome into Germany to take him vppe <hi>5000.</hi> footemen. He alſo wrote letters to certain knights of <hi>Anda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louzia,</hi> to bring vnto him olde ſouldiours. Moreouer he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded great ſtore of ordenance, wepons, armour, &amp; other munition &amp; victualls to be prouided &amp; brought together, &amp; that all theſe things might be the more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modiouſly tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, he commaunded ſhippes to be ſtaied in all hauens of his kingdome. The number of the ſouldiours that he leuied in his owne kingdome was great, but they were ill furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, &amp; freſhwater ſouldiours, taken vp of clownes, &amp; huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handmen, and a rable nothing fit for the field.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:15178:76"/>
               <p>As for the Germaines, they were alſo freſh water ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diour, and vnſkilfull of martiall matters, and when they came to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> they fell ſick, and aboue <hi>2000.</hi> of them died. There came alſo vnto the king, <hi>600.</hi> Italians, with whom the Pope had furniſhed the Counte of Ireland, who being ariued at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> offered his ſeruice to the king &amp; promiſed to follow him in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iourney. Moreouer the king cauſed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation to be made with ſound of Trumpet, thoroughout his whole kingdome, that all Noblemen and Gentlemen his vaſſailes, ſhould attend vpon him to the warres, vppon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

So then all things néedefull for an armie being prouided, and ſufficient ſtore of ſhippes and boates gathered together, he commaunded the ordenaunce, victualls, munition, horſes, and other neceſſaries to be ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, that when the feaſt of Saint <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> (on which day he had determined to leaue his houſe) drew néere, ther might be nothing to let &amp; hinder, but that the armie might be embarked, and tranſported into <hi>Africa.</hi>

                  </hi> the king of <hi>Marocco</hi> was admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and aduertiſed of theſe things, and what the king of <hi>Portugall</hi> entended againſt him: he was verye ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full therefore, not ſo much becauſe he feared the King of <hi>Portugall</hi> his forces, as for that he being well affected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men of the Chriſtian Religion, did foreſée in minde that <hi>Africa</hi> would be the graue of the King of Portugall, yea, though he brought with him thriſe ſo great an Armie as he had.</p>

Furthermore, <hi>Abdelmelec,</hi> as he was a man of a ſharpe witte, and in
<pb facs="tcp:15178:77"/>ſuch matters of ſurpaſſing diligence and prouidence, began alſo to make prouiſion for the warres, and to bethinke him of things neceſſarie therefore. Wherefore he commaunded Tents to be ſet vp in a fielde a league from <hi>Marocco,</hi> and warres to be openlie proclaimed through his kingdome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Chriſtians: the which thing highlie pleaſed the Moores.</p>
               <p>He alſo commanded a great number of great Guns, and ſpeciallie field peeces, and alſo infinite ſtore of victualls and of horſes and Camells, for to carrie neceſſaries for their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, to be prouided. Which being done, when he heard that the king of <hi>Portugal</hi> was now vpon the point to goe a ſhip boord, and to ariue at <hi>Arzil,</hi> he alſo went out of <hi>Marocco</hi> the ſixtéenth day of April with great applauſe of the people, and with almoſt an infinite companie of men into the campe, and kept the armie in the Tents, where he ſtaied twentie daies, looking for the reſt of his forces. From hence he marched with Enſignes diſplaied by ſmall iourneyes towards <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zill,</hi> and that he might the more commodiouſlie ioyne with thoſe forces that he looked for, he ſtaied a little while at <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocen,</hi> which is in the confines of his kingdome. But the king of <hi>Portugall,</hi> who was hot ſet on his voiage, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded before he went on ſhipboord, proceſſions and praiers to be publikelie made throughout all the kingdome, that God might vouchſafe to graunt happie ſucceſſe to this enterpriſe, and victorie againſt his enimie.</p>
               <p>At length on Midſommer daie the whole armie was embarked, and the next daie after verie earlie in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, king <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> (hauing nominated before ſeauen of the chiefe of the Realme gouernours of the kingdome) becauſe the Cardinall his vnkle had refuſed the gouernment, for that he could not intreate the king to relinquiſh the voiage, launched out of the Hauen, and hoiſed vp ſailes the <hi>26.</hi> of Iune, with ten or twelue Galeons, in whom were embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked almoſt all the whole Nobilitie of his kingdome. The ſea was paſſing calme, the fléete of the whole armie launch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from <hi>Lisbon,</hi> was of great and ſmall veſſelles about a
<pb facs="tcp:15178:77"/>thouſand and thrée hundreth ſaile, ſo pleaſant a ſpectacle, that many ſayd they neuer ſawe ſuch a fléete before, and hauing a good winde they ariued at <hi>Caliz</hi> on Saint <hi>Peters</hi> eue. The king being receiued with ſingular gratulation and ioy of the people, ſtaied there fiftéene dayes, for to prouide ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries that he lacked, and that he might tranſport with him certaine bands of Spaniards, that were leuied for him in <hi>Andaluzia.</hi> Which things being diſpatched, he departed from <hi>Caliz</hi> the eight of Iulie, and ſailed with the Galeons towards <hi>Tangar,</hi> but commanded the reſt of the Fléete to kéepe their courſe towards <hi>Arzil.</hi> So the tenth of Iulie the king ariued at <hi>Tangar,</hi> but before he was come into the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, <hi>Mahamet</hi> ſent his ſonne, a child almoſt ten yéeres old, named <hi>Muley Xeque,</hi> againſt the king in a ſmall veſſell, whom the king did verie gentlie and curteouſlie ſalute. But béeing come on land, he ſhewed greater ſignes of good will and friendſhip to <hi>Mahamet,</hi> and verie liberallie offered his trauaile &amp; aide for to reſtore him into his kingdome. When <hi>Mahamet</hi> was come to the kings preſence, although he had before ſufficientlie certefied him both by Letters &amp; Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours of his will and mind: yet that he might more ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie prouide for his ſtate, he did then more-plentifullie and more at large open vnto him by ſpéech what he was min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to doe: and did tell him how that his vnkle, ſupported by the power and ſtrength of the Turke, did vſurpe the kingdome, the which hée had taken from him by force. Hee added moreouer, that the vaſſalles and ſubiects of <hi>Abdel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melec</hi> did practiſe nothing elſe, and were wholie buſied, how they might ſecretlie kill <hi>Abdelmelec,</hi> or at the leaſt forſake him, and reuoult to <hi>Mahamet,</hi> and that thereof hée receiued dailie without interceſſion Letters from the Péeres of the Realme, in the which Letters they promiſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noult vnto him, as ſoone as euer hée would come agaynſt the enimie, yea, and if it were but with a ſmall power Hée woulde alſo perſwade the king of Portugall that he ſhoulde not fight with the <hi>Abdelmelec,</hi> but onelie go into the field: which thing if hée did, then his vnkles ſouldiours
<pb facs="tcp:15178:78"/>would immediatlie bée at his deuotion and command. Hée promiſed alſo to giue the king of <hi>Portugall</hi> two or thrée Hauens in <hi>Barbarie,</hi> with their territories adioyning, and for ſuretie thereof hée gaue his ſonne in hoſtage. The king of <hi>Portugal</hi> as hée was a Prince of noble paſſing good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, credited all that <hi>Mahamet</hi> ſpake, and aſſented to his petition without conditions, couenants, and ſureties. From hence hée went with <hi>Mahamet</hi> to <hi>Arzil,</hi> where his armie was, and there <hi>Muley Xeque</hi> was Generall of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſmall forces, and had with him the horſemen and foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the gariſon of <hi>Tangar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The king came to <hi>Arzil</hi> on Sundaie, béeing the foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>téenth of Iulie, and as ſoone as hée was come on ſhoare, hée commaunded the Ordenaunce, victuall, and the reſt of the warlyke furniture to bée diſbarked, but ſent foure ſhippes well appointed to <hi>Maſſaga,</hi> to carrie thether <hi>Muley Xeque</hi> his pledge: but commaunded his campe to bée pitched néere the walles of <hi>Arzill,</hi> and it to bée entrenched rounde with rampires and ditches, that hée might lye there the ſafer.</p>
               <p>But that wée may returne to <hi>Abdelmelec:</hi> as ſoone as hée came to <hi>Temocen,</hi> a greate multitude of horſemen that ſerued with ſhéelde and Speare, and many other forces ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with him. But thrée dayes after hée came thether, hée fell verie ſicke, the cauſe wherof, as then no man vnderſtood. But anone after when he felt a mightie torment in his ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, it was eaſilie vnderſtoode whereof it came: that is, hée had eaten gréedelie of ſowre milke, which had curded in his ſtomacke. That he might caſt it vp, hée aſſayed in vaine two and almoſt thrée daies to make himſelfe vomite (as he had vſed to doe) and ſo at the length be caſt vp a great gob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet of Chéeſe, which made his ſtomacke ſo weake and faint, that afterward it could concoct no meate. Alſo his ſickneſſe was increaſed by harde and ill lodging. But as ſoone as hée heard that the king of Portugall was departed from <hi>Caliz,</hi> to ſayle to <hi>Arzil,</hi> although hée were at that time no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing well, yet hée commaunded his armie to march for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb facs="tcp:15178:78"/>towardes <hi>Arzil,</hi> he himſelfe béeing carried in an horſe litter.</p>
               <p>And now he was from <hi>Alcazara</hi> (where his brother ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected him with an armie) not aboue a dayes iourney, but when hée drew néere him, his comming was receiued with a great peale of great and ſmall ſhot, in token of ioye. And there hée was forced to pitch vp his Tents, and to lie there in a Campe certaine daies, ſtaying for other forces and to recouer his ſtrength weakened by ſickneſſe. Wherefore as ſoone as thoſe forces that hée looked for were come, he ſooke muſter of his whole armie, and found fiftéene thouſand foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men harguebuziers, of whome fiue thouſand were verie choice olde ſouldiours, and the reſt freſh water ſouldioure, and of none experience.</p>
               <p>Then he had two thouſand Argolets, two and fortie thouſand <hi>Alarbes</hi> with ſhéeld and ſpere, &amp; ſixe and twentie field péeces verie well furniſhed, and Gunners verie good and readie. Moreouer, all his whole armie was verie well prouided of victualles, and his ſouldiours well paide, the which is one of the chiefeſt thinges in warres, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Generall ought to haue moſt ſpeciall care. So his ſouldiours were paide euerie moneth a Duckate or péece of golde, wherefore they were alſo all readie to abide all extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie for <hi>Abdelmelec,</hi> and to ſpendr their liues for him, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the horſe men of the <hi>Alarbes,</hi> whome hée little truſted, as he that was not ignoraunt that they were full of falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode, nor gaue their mindes to anie thing elſe than to gette booties, and to rob they cared not whom.</p>
               <p>And that I may tell you all in few words, he had more truſt in none than in thoſe fiue thouſand old ſouldiours har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuziers. But the thing that gréeued <hi>Abdelmelec</hi> moſt, was, that at ſo great and perillous a battaile, whereat hee muſt néeds be preſent himſelfe and order it, vnleſſe he wold endaunger the whole ſtate of his Kingdome, hee dyd finde himſelfe to bée ſo weake and quite broken with ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the which the burning Dogge dayes dyd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:15178:79"/>
               <p>Wherefore he laie ſtill there eight or nine daies, vntill that the king of Portugall conſtrained him, yea, vnwilling for to march forward, and to encampe at <hi>Alcazar.</hi> In the meane time the king of <hi>Portugal</hi> béeing iſſued out of <hi>Arzill,</hi> and readie to march, muſtered his armie, wherein (beſides the thouſand ſtipendaries, that he had left to kéepe the fléete, and the two thouſand that hée had ſent to <hi>Maſſaga</hi>) he had foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>téene thonſand footemen, and two thouſand horſmen, a great part armed.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, there were thrée thouſand pioners, and aboue a thouſand cochmen, and almoſt an infinite number of drud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, flaues, Negroes, mullotters, horſe boies, land reſſes, and thoſe ſwéete wenches that the Frenchmen doe merrilie call the daughters of delight, for now the world is come to that, we thinke we cannot kéepe wars without theſe ſnailes. So that all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inſauorie companie of baggage did excéede ſixe and twentie thouſand perſons. He had alſo ſixe and thirtie field péeces, and <hi>1500.</hi> wagons full of mattes, veſſell, and houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde ſtuffe onelie for noble men. He might in deede haue brought a greater power in this voiage, as wel out of <hi>Spain</hi> as out of other Countries, but that he giuing credite to the words of <hi>Muley Hamet,</hi> who ſaid that the armie of <hi>Abdel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melec</hi> would reuoult vnto him, he diſmiſſed many Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards that would haue gone aboord at <hi>Caliz,</hi> and did more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilie diſcharge them, that vnder pretence of ſickneſſe, deſired that they might goe home. In the armie that followed him were thrée thouſand Germanes, ſixe hundreth Italians, two thouſand Spaniardes, ſire hundreth Souldiours of <hi>Tangar,</hi> two thouſand fiue hundreth light horſemen, in whome hée repoſed his greateſt truſt. The reſt were Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugalls. And the greater parte of theſe forces had their wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ſparingly and verie ill paide them, and were diſtreſſed with want, and many other ills, for now victuals beganne to faile, the which were ſo ſparinglie diſtributed, that many died for hunger.</p>
               <p>The fault was in the purueiours, who do full often in the time of wars through their knauerie, caſt princes &amp; generals
<pb facs="tcp:15178:79"/>into extreme calamities. But that which was worſt of all, the greater part of the armie conſiſted of freſh water ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours, who were without ſkill of martiall diſcipline, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had euer ſéene battaile or campe. That I may omit thoſe eight thouſand that bare long pikes, then the which kinde of ſouldiours there is none of leſſe vſe and ſeruice, &amp; more vnfit for wars in <hi>Barbarie.</hi> By that time the king of <hi>Portugal</hi> had muſtered his armie, <hi>Abdelmelec</hi> was come to <hi>Alcazar,</hi> with an armie full of fury and wrath. Which cauſed the King of <hi>Portugall</hi> his Counſell to deſire their Prince in no caſe to ioyne in battaile with his enimies, who did farre ſurpaſſe him in men and might, but rather that he would march with his armie to <hi>Lariſſa,</hi> &amp; take that fortified place, and prouide for himſelfe.</p>
               <p>But when <hi>Abdelmelec</hi> knew by eſpies almoſt euerie houre what was done in the campe of the Chriſtians, and how weake the <hi>Portugall</hi> forces were, and how coldly all things were ordered, and therefore did ſée that the wretchen king being in the prime of his yeares, was néere to death and deſiruction: he wrought by all meanes he could, that he ſhould not be forced to fight a battaile, becauſe he was not otherwiſe verie ill affected towards Chriſtians. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he laboured priuile and ſecretly by certaine men, and they moſtly merchants, to certifie the king of Portugall of the guiles and deceits of <hi>Mahamet</hi> (that had brought him into theſe daungers, and ſo preſent ruine and ieoperdie of life.) But although theſe aduiſes of <hi>Abdelmelec</hi> were not vnknowne to the king of Portugall, and his counſaillours aduiſed him the verie ſame that <hi>Abdelmelec</hi> dyd, and went about to withdraw him from his purpoſe: yet he wilfullie contemned all that could be ſayde, not onely that he might fulfill his burning deſire to fight, and to trye his ſtrength and valiant heart, but alſo chiefelie becauſe he truſted the promiſes of <hi>Mahamet,</hi> which he beléeued to be verſe true. To he ſhort, his Counſaile laboured to their vttermoſt, to diſuade the king from ioyning in battaile, but rather adei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him to march to <hi>Lariſſa,</hi> and they wrought ſo much by
<pb facs="tcp:15178:80"/>blaming and brging him, that the king at length yéelded to goe to <hi>Lariſſa.</hi> Wherevpon the Nauie was commaunded to make ſaile towards <hi>Lariſſa,</hi> &amp; he himſelfe marched by land the therwards, going out of <hi>Arzil</hi> the <hi>29.</hi> of Iulie (which was tueſ daie) and thrée daies he marched, but making ſmall iourneies by reaſen of the multitude of haggage that follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed the armie, and then he fraied the fridaie, becauſe he loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for ſome aide from <hi>Arzil.</hi> The Saterdaie verie earlie he began to march againe, and at length came to the riuer of <hi>Mazaga,</hi> which runneth to <hi>Lariſſa,</hi> and there he lodged, wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and wardes being diligentlie appointed and ſet after his vſed manner, for feare of the Moores that were diſpearſed round about him.</p>
               <p>At that time <hi>Abdelmelec</hi> remained at <hi>Alcazar,</hi> verie weake and ſicklie, and although he heard that the Portugall was gone out of <hi>Arzil,</hi> and was encamped at <hi>Mazaga,</hi> yet he would not ſtirre out of his place, vntill that he vnderſtood by eſpies, that his enimies made towards <hi>Alcazar.</hi> For hée would haue ſuffered his enimie to haue taken <hi>Lariſſa,</hi> thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that the Portugall being contented with the taking of it, would from thence returne home. But when he was aduertiſed that the Saterdaie morning his enimie marched forward, he alſo at the ſame time made towards <hi>Arzil</hi> by <hi>Alcazar.</hi> And when he had marched with his armie a little more than halfe a league (that is, aboue a mile) he encamped on a certaine high downe in the ſight of the Portugails, who were a league from that hill, and were encamped on a great and pleaſant plaine. And being néere to the riuer of <hi>Alcazar,</hi> he commanded his Tents to be pitched on the banke of the riuer, not farre from confluence of another riuer that goeth to <hi>Lariſsa.</hi> After that noone was paſt, he and his armie refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed themſelues from the heate of the Sunne in their tents, hée taking his reſt in an horſe litter.

<pb facs="tcp:15178:80"/>king of Portugall was come the Saterdaie morning to the riuer of <hi>Lariſsa,</hi> &amp; was encamped néere to the place where he thought ther might be a foord fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to paſſe ouer his ordena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; was minded to go to <hi>Lariſsa:</hi> then <hi>Mahamet,</hi> a ſubtile fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, ambitions, and deceitfull, thinking with himſelfe, that if the Portugall ſhould enter <hi>Lariſsa,</hi> and did conſider the power and moſt puiſant armie of <hi>Abdelmelec,</hi> that then hee would returne home, and doe nothing, and leaue him forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and alone to be deuoured of his enimies: he reſolued to talke with the Portugall that daie, and to dehort him from the iourney y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> he purpoſed towards <hi>Lariſsa:</hi> and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> he might the better bring it to paſſe, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he began with a craftie tale to tel him that many Moores horſe men had fled vnto him from <hi>Abdelmelec,</hi> &amp; that the reſt of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> armie went about to do the ſame. That if he ſhould goe to <hi>Lariſsa,</hi> then all men would blame him, as one fearefull, and ſuch an one as repoſed ſaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in running awaie. That <hi>Abdelmelec</hi> was naked of friendes: for hée handled his Souldiours hardlie, and that they didde therefore minde to doe him a miſchtefe, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by ſlaying of him, or elſe by forſaking him in the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile. That it was better and more wiſedome to march to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Alcazar,</hi> namelie, ſéeing that enimie that came againſt him had not ſo much heart as to goe about to impeach him.</p>
               <p>He added alſo other arguments making for his purpoſe, by the which hee diſſ waded the Portagall from going to <hi>Lariſsa,</hi> and to ſaie the truth, it had otherwiſe bene an harde matter for him to haue gon forward, ſéeing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> his enimy was ſo néere. The Sundaie morning verie earlie the Portugall remoued his campe, and went vp a long the banke of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, that he might come into the high waie that leadeth from <hi>Arzil</hi> to <hi>Alcazar,</hi> and when he had found a foord, he ſtaied, and commaunded the pioners to make it readie againſt the next daie.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Abdelmelec</hi> vnderſtanding y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> intent of the Portugal, cauſed a ſigne to be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by ſound of Trumpet, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> euerie man
<pb facs="tcp:15178:81"/>ſhould make himſelfe readie to fight. Wherefore in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoone he marching forward almoſt a quarter of a mile, ſtayed and commaunded his armie to breath, vntill he vnderſtoode what his enimie, that was about halfe a league off, ment to doe. For as we haue tolde you before, <hi>Abdelmelec</hi> had determined not to ioyne in battaile, except the Portugall did firſt deſire it.</p>
               <p>When the Portugall being encamped along the Riuer of <hi>Lariſſa,</hi> heard that the enimie made towards him, he was forced alſo to remoue his Campe, and to put his people in array of battaile, not for to fight, becauſe the fourde of the Riuer could not be paſſed ouer without very great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and alſo there was a great troupe of Moores that dyd continually prouoke his men with ſkirmiſhes, but that he might defenſe himſelfe, and he vſed the mightie Riuer in ſtéede of a wall againſt the enimie. In this ſort thoſe two Armies, when either did looke that the other ſhould beginne the battaile, kept themſelues in, the reſt of the day. So when it drew towards night, and <hi>Abdelmelec</hi> ſaw that the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugals ſtirred not out of their place, although y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chiefe Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines were verie inſtant on him to fight, and to giue the ſignall of battaile, yet becauſe night was at hand, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the retreate to be ſounded, and ledde his Armie backe to their Campe. But yet he commaunded proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be made in the Campe by ſounde of Trumpet, that no man ſhould put of his armour, nor lay downe his wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon that night, and alſo commaunded the watch to be dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, as he alſo did the night before, that no man could flye out of his Campe vnto <hi>Muley Hamet.</hi> And doubtleſſe this watch was the cauſe of <hi>Mahamets</hi> ouerthrow, becauſe that no man durſt to goe out of his ward &amp; tente. In the meane time <hi>Abdelmelec</hi> was fully reſolued to fight, for ſéeing he had heard that many horſemen, and men that had abiured the faith, were fled out of his Campe, and did feare that if he deferred to fight the next day, that then the greater part of his armie would reuolt: he thought that he muſt ſtaye no longer, but determined to goe on forward, and to aduenture
<pb facs="tcp:15178:81"/>the battaile. Wherefore he commanded that it ſhoulde bée ſignified by a Trumpet, that all men ſhoulde be in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and prepared either to liue or die. After that the king of Portugall ſawe that his enimies were retired into their camp, he alſo did the like, and lodged in the verie ſame place from whence he came. He aſſembling in counſaile the chiefe men of the armie that night, determined the next day, being mundaie, to offer the enimie battaile. And it is the conſtant ſame of all men, that <hi>Muley Hamet</hi> gaue him coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile to beginne the battaile the next daie in the euening, not ſo much becauſe by this meanes the ſouldiours of <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delmelec</hi> might the more commodiouſlie rououlf vnto him, as for that he coulde not by reaſon of the darkneſſe of the night remedie it, if anie confuſion did ariſe in his armie. This counſaile as good and wholeſome was approued of all men, and therefore the king commanded that the ſame night it ſhoulde bee proclaimed in the campe, that the next daie béeing mundaie, as ſoone as it was light, the ordenance and the carriages ſhoulde bée ſpeedelie paſſed ouer the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter through the foorde. For if they had tarried longer, no doubt the enimies wold haue impeached their paſſage, which alſo was the cauſe that the battaile was not beg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The foord béeing made readie, the armie ſtraight waie paſſed ouer, and they encamped beyond the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and alſo the king began to arange his battailes, to ſet forth his bands, and to diſpoſe his ordenance in commodious places.</p>
               <p>He alſo made a long Oration to his ſouldiours, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with curteous &amp; louing ſpéech, vſing alſo verie ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall arguments for to preſent themſelues to perills cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiouſlie, for the honour of God, and the increaſe of the Chriſtian Religion, promiſing them great riches, fauour, honours, and priuiledges, willing them to haue good hope of the victorie, ſpeciallie through the helpe of God, in whom he had all his whole truſt fixed.</p>
               <p>The like did the noble men that followed the king in this voiage doe, to their vttermoſt, name lie, the Biſhoppes of

                  <hi>Coimbra</hi> and <hi>Portua,</hi> and alſo the Popes Commiſſarie, and many other ſpirituall perſons. In theſe adhortations all the forenoone was ſpent. On the other ſide <hi>Abdelmelec</hi> ſéeing the Chriſtians come in battaile araie, he alſo commanded the ſignall to be ſounded throughout his campe, and willed the Captaines to bring forth their ſouldiours, &amp; to diſpoſe them into the order that he had preſcribed. And becauſe that hée through ſickneſſe was verie weake in bodie, and of coulour pale and wan, and by reaſon of the palſie could in no wiſe vſe his armes, the wiſer and warier of his counſailours dehor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him from comming in perſon into this inſtant battaile: to whom he would in no caſe conſent, but whereas he had not come on horſe his back in more than twentie daies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he reſolued to leaue his horſe litter, and to bée clothed in moſt ſumptuous apparell, and to be adorned with infinite moſt precious ſtones, and moſt excellent pearles of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Eaſt, and mounted on a goodlie and luſtie ſtrong horſe. Being in this ſort prepared to fight, he began to adhort his men to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, promiſing honors and great warlike rewards to them that ſhould behaue themſelues like men, and doe their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and accompliſh their charges valiantlie. With the which wordes and promiſes he did ſo incourage and inflame his ſouldiours, into whoſe ſight he had not come long time before, by reaſon of his ſickneſſe, that they ſéemed to bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired by <hi>Mars,</hi> and to runne to the battaile like Lions. And although at the beginning there were ſome that went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to murther him, or reuolt from him, yet now they chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging their mindes, did ſo ſubiect themſelues vnto him with all reuerence, that they diſdained not, yea to kiſſe his féete. At length his armie béeing caſt into the forme of a ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circle, or croiſant, and diuided into thrée battailes, he began to aduance his armie in that order that this table doeth ſhew.</p>
               <p>The right wing the Prince, the brother of <hi>Abdelmelec</hi> dyd leade, who had with him a thouſand verie choice Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuziers on horſebacke noted. He had alſo ten thouſand

Theſe did the Vireroie <hi>Mahamet Zareo</hi> leade. The third battaile, which was the maine battaile, wherein king <hi>Abdelmelec</hi> ſtoode, was defenced with harquebuziers on foote. Thou dyd the king followe, enuironed with his garde of two hundreth ſouldiours, that had forſworne the faith, who were all wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned with halbardes.

The thing
<pb facs="tcp:15178:84"/>was done in the ſight and preſence of the king, who through the counſaile of them about him was yet in his Coch, but as ſoone as he ſawe the flight and diſorder of his men, hee ſpée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dely mounted on a horſe ſtrangely bardbed, and accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Duke of <hi>Auero</hi> and other men of armes, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the enime. But although he were carried againſt his enimies with that force and féeſe, that he brake their araie againe, yet becauſe the armie of the Moores did not abandon the place, thoſe horſemen that were ſcarſe fiue hundreth, were forced to retire: whom the Moores followed with ſuch force, that flying many of them, they forced the reſt to runne among their footemen with ſuch haſt, that they ouerranne and troade to death a great number of their owne footmen, and committed a miſerable miſorder and ſlaughter. In the meane while all the forces of the Mahometan armie running downe from the hill, began to charge the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans with great violence. In that conflict the Duke of <hi>Aue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> was ſlaine, and many other noble and valiant men, and alſo the horſe of the king of Portugall was ſlaine, but hée himſelfe ſafe and vnhurt, and the great ordenaunce which ſerued the Chriſtians to no vſe in this battaile, was taken. Now as touching the right wing of the Moores: the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours thereof neuer ceaſed from the beginning of the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile to powre downe ſhowers of ſhot vpon the Chriſtians, yea, and moouing out of their place, but alwayes kéeping the croiſant figure of their armie, they beganne to incloſe the Portugall armie, and to charge the hindermeſt battaile of the ſide.</p>
               <p>Wherefore the king (who had mounted another freſh horſe) perceiuing that the hindermoſt battayle néeded ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, taking with him fiue hundreth men of armes, who hadde beene appointed for that purpoſe, charged the third tune the Moores that were vnder <hi>Muley Hamet,</hi> the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Abdelmelec:</hi> whom he did ſo ſkarre, that he forced them to giue ground more than halfe a league, ſlaying ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and ſcattering the reſt.</p>
               <p>But ſéeing he was alone, and had no man that woulde
<pb facs="tcp:15178:84"/>follow him, he was forced with great griefe, and full ſore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his will to retire to his armie, for to beholde the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull ſight of the entire diſcomfiture of his whole forces. For the Moores in the lefte wing after they hadde taken the Ordenance of the Chriſtians, purſuing the victorie, dyd alſo ſo diſcomfite thoſe Chriſtians that ſtoode néere to the banke of the riuer, that they ranne vppon the forces of <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley Mahamet</hi> (that ſtoode betwéene the Chriſtians and the Riuer) and made miſerable ſpoile and ſlaughter of them, yea, and many of <hi>Mahamet</hi> his men ranne vppon the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian troupes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Muley Mahamet</hi> ſéeking to ſaue himſelfe by flight, as he would haue paſſed ouer at the foord of the riuer of <hi>Lariſla,</hi> which is myrie and mooriſh, was caſt out of the ſaddle by his horſe that ſtriued and ſtruggeled to get out of the durt, and beeing vnſkilfull to ſwimme, was drowned and peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in the riuer. The victours Moores following the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed, came to the warde of <hi>Muley Hamet,</hi> the brother of <hi>Abdelmelec,</hi> and there either ſlue or carried awaie pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners the principall men of the Chriſtians being incloſed, and as it were brought into a pinfolde. So then our men being thus encloſed on all partes, and not hauing Gunne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouder (for that through negligence had taken fire, and was all conſumed) nor anie other thing to defende themſelues, or elſe had with indifferent ſlaughter as wel deſtroyed their owne fellowes as their enimies, ranne awaie amaine, ſo that through headlong and haſtie flight, one ranne vppon another, and many were ſquiſed with the weight of horſes running ouer them with a miſerable ſlaughter. For yée might ſée the heapes of men troden downe and ſquiſed lye as thicke as ſheafes of Wheate caſt downe in a Barnes floure.</p>
               <p>The enimies alſo that did inſatiablie thirſt for Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an bloud, ſhotte off their Harquebuſies thicke and thrée folde vppon them, with whom they did hurt not a fewe of their owne men, and foulie tare them. But as for the eight thouſand pikemen, whome the Portugall had in the
<pb facs="tcp:15178:85"/>field, ſéeing they did nothing elſe, then leaue ſo many pikes for the barbarous enimie, experience it ſelfe taught how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle good they dyd in the battaile. For when the King vſed them for ſo many harquebuziers, whom he ſhuld haue ſent againſt the enimie, by taking them, he deuiſed aſſured ruine for himſelfe. And although the Chriſtian ſtate was now become deſperate, yet the king of Portugal ceaſed not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damage the enimie, now in this quarter, now in that, being accompanied with no nto then ſeuen or eight ſouldiours of <hi>Tangar,</hi> for the noble men, gentlemen, &amp; horſemen of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal were ſo cowardly, and ſo delicate, (they ſay) that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them leauing their horſes, got them to ſhadowy pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and vnder the ſhadow of the wagons, for to coole them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: with this minde, that when they ſaw all loſt, they might ſéeke to ſaue themſelues by running awaye. And ſo when they began to flye, part on foote, and part on horſeback towards <hi>Arzill,</hi> from whence they came: the Moores folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with ſuch violence &amp; ſpeede, and ſpecially the horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, (who were yet freſh) y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they made a miſerable ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of them. Yet king <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> forſaketh not his people: thinking it diſhonorable to ſéeke ſafetie by flight, and with thoſe few that followed him, behaued himſelfe valiantly. He ſlue ſo manie, he ſent ſo many to hell, that many called him the lightning, and few durſt to looke him in the face, or to defend themſelues againſt him. At length about a three ſcore of <hi>Abdelmelec</hi> his ſouldiours ſeeking glorie by ſlaying of a King, encloſed him. Then he ſéeing no way left him to eſcape, commaunded one of them that followed him, to hold vp a white ſcarfe hanged on a launce, in ſigne y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he would yeeld. But they that had encloſed him (that is to wit, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larbes,</hi> a kinde of people of all other moſt barbarous &amp; cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell) ſuppoſing that by this ſigne he dyd call the Portugalls to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Moores followed the flying Chriſtians vntill it was late nights. So when all were vanquiſhed and ſcattered, or brought into wretched captiuitie, <hi>Muley Hamet</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the retraite to bée ſounded, and returned to the Campe with the bodie of his brother <hi>Abdelmelec,</hi> and it was euen night when he came thether, and ſtraight waie was the death of king <hi>Abdelmelec</hi> publiſhed, and thereby alſo <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley Hamet</hi> acknowledged and receiued for king, and all the whole armie was verie ſorrowfull for the loſſe of <hi>Abdel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melec.</hi> Although y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> this ouerthrowe was no doubt ſent vs by God for our ſinnes, yet two hundreth or few leſſe, with hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie ſucceſſe eſcaped out of the handes of the Barbarians a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue and well, of whome thrée ſcore were horſemen, and the reſt footemen, and among them <hi>Don Antonio,</hi> a Portugall, who was deliuered by a certaine Moore out of the handes of his enimies, and brought to <hi>Tanger.</hi> But there were ſlaine of Chriſtians in this battaile, aboue twelue thouſand. For all the whole field was filled with dead bodies of men, yea, and of horſes, mules, aſſes, oxen, and other beaſts of bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and draught.</p>
               <p>Among the nobler ſort that died in this battaile, were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides king <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Auero,</hi> the Biſhoppes of <hi>Coimbra</hi> and <hi>Portua,</hi> the Commiſſarie General ſent by the Pope, the Marques of <hi>Treland, Chriſtopher de Tauora,</hi> and many other knightes and Gentlemen, whome I doe omit for breuities ſake. The Tueſdaie, which was the fift of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt, the new king ſent in the morning a band of footmen to ſeeke out the men ſlaine on their ſide, of whome a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand fiue hundreth being knowen, were buried in the ſame place, among whome were many valiaunt and renowmed Captaines, friendes and familiars of king of <hi>Abdelmelec,</hi> They being buried after their manner, the bodie of <hi>Muley Mahamet</hi> (who was the author of ſo many euils and ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) was found on the banke and ſands of the riuer, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he had ben drowned.</p>
               <p>The bodie of the king of Portugall was alſo found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the bodies of the ſlaine Chriſtians, by two of his
<pb facs="tcp:15178:86"/>ſeruants that were priſoners: whom the new king had ſent for that purpoſe in the hard morning, promiſing them liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, if they did finde the kings bodie. Wherefore when they had found it naked, they brought it to the new king couered with their owne clothes, and with it was alſo brought the bodie of <hi>Muley Mahamet.</hi> Theſe dead bodies of thrée kings being brought into one Pauilion, made an horrible ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and wrong teares from the beholders. For what more ſorrowfull and horrible a ſight could there bée, than to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde thrée moſt mightie kings, that died in one battaile, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together. The armie of one of whom was vanquiſhed when he liued, &amp; after he was dead did ſtraight waie ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the armie of the other two kinges: and whereas all thrée did aſpire to the kingdome of <hi>Marocco,</hi> none of them helde it. But this thing being ſhut from mans ſenſes, and reſerued to the hidden iudgement of Gods maieſtie, I doe omit.</p>
               <p>The bodie of <hi>Abdelmelec</hi> was carried in an horſe litter to <hi>Feſſe,</hi> diſtant about twentie leagues from <hi>Alcazar,</hi> that it might be buried there. All the horſemen with one legion or regiment of footemen attended on the coarſe. Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought to <hi>Fes,</hi> and receiued with the great ſorrowe of the Citizens, was laide in the tombe of his aunceſtours, in the verie ſame ſumptuous apparell, and precious garniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of gems that the king died in. Many of the noble men that were taken priſoners, were verie deſirous to redéeme the bodie of the king of <hi>Bortugall,</hi> and they offered <hi>Muley Mahamet</hi> ten thouſand Duckates if hée would vouchſafe to ſend it to <hi>Tangar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Barbarian aunſwered, that it was not ſéeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to ſell a dead mannes bodie, yet notwithſtanding if they woulde giue him <hi>Tangar</hi> or <hi>Arzil,</hi> they ſhoulde haue the bodie, but when that was not in their handes and power, they coulde goe no farther: yet this they obtained of the new king, that hée ſuffered the bodie of the king of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugall to bée carried to <hi>Alcazar,</hi> where alſo it was buried in the Hoſpital, (which is in the pallace of the gouernour of
<pb facs="tcp:15178:86"/>the Towne,) and ſome appointed to kéepe it continuallie, leaſt the Chriſtians ſhoulde ſteale it awaie. But as for the bodie of <hi>Muley Mahamet,</hi> the newe king his vnkle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the ſkinne to bée pulled off (becauſe he had béene the author of ſo many ſlaughters) and to bée ſalted, and then ſtuffed with ſtrawe, and to bée carried about thorough out all prouinces of his kingdome, for to deferre all other for attempting the like at anie time after. The men, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, boyes, ſlaues, and blacke Moores taken in this battaile by the Moores, were in number aboue fouretéene thouſand, and they béeing the next daie diuided among the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, were carried into all Prouinces of <hi>Barbarie.</hi> For as the Moores came out of all places to the battaile, ſo euerie man carried home with him his priſoners and ſpoyle. But although the counſailours of the new king were verie ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt with him to beſiege either <hi>Tanger</hi> or <hi>Arzill,</hi> namelie, ſéeing that there was no man that woulde reſiſt or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it: yet hée refuſed ſo to doe, but rather prepared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to goe to <hi>Fes,</hi> that hauing taken the poſſeſſion of that Citie, hée might bée ſeiſed of the inheritance of all the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes: thinking that there woulde not otherwiſe want them, that would aſſaie to ſet him beſides the ſaddle, if they did perceiue him to be ſlacke therein. And hée was acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for king but with vnwilling heartes, and in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner repining thereat: neither in déede was hée receiued with the ſame chéerefulneſſe and ioye, that they vſed to receiue other kings: and the cauſe thereof was, for that there was no mettall in this newe king <hi>Hamet,</hi> an art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe man, not caring for martiall matters, nor ſuch an one as was fit for to vpholde the dignitie of a king, but contrariwiſe effeminate, nice, giuen to delicacies, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyghtes and pleaſures, and lurking at home in the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace.</p>
               <p>Hée was then about nine and twentie or thirtie yéeres of age, of coulour blacke, not bigge, but yet faule and weake, and of no ſtrength, and much leſſe ſkilfull of things,
<pb facs="tcp:15178:87"/>and endued with that wiſdome which is required in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerning of a kingdome, and that I may comprehend all in few wordes, he was altogether vnlike his brother <hi>Abdel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melec,</hi> for he was of a meane ſtature, of a fine proportion of bodie, with brode ſhoulders, white face, but intermixed with red, which did gallantlie garniſh his chéekes, a blacke beard thicke, and curled, great eies and graie. In ſumme, he was a verie proper man, and verie comelie in all his actions and ieſtures, and verie ſtrong: the which ſtrength he conſerued by continuallie exerciſing of himſelfe in ſkirmiſhes, and in bending of bowes. He ſpake Spaniſh verie well, and with a great grace, he could alſo write in Spaniſh. But hée had the Italian tongue beſt of all other, yet he tooke moſt delight in the Turkiſh tongue, ſo that for loue of it he cared not for the Arabian, the which was his mother tongue, and wherein he was accounted for the moſt excellent Poet of his time. He was ingenious, ſharpe witted, and paſſing prudent and wiſe, wheras in other things than ſpeciallie in the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a kingdome. He plaied wel on diuerſe inſtruments, and alſo daunced excellentlie, but delighted aboue meaſure in armes, and the art of warre, in which things he alſo exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed himſelfe much: inſomuch, that he made with his owne hands many great péeces of ordenance, that are yet at this daie in <hi>Barbarie.</hi> For he was of a ſingular and wonderfull wit in all things that he went about or tooke in hand. And although he profeſſed the religion of <hi>Mahamet,</hi> yet he ſo lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Chriſtians, and of them Spaniardes, that I cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe with wordes the loue and good will which he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards many captiues &amp; priſoners. For he ſuffered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to returne into <hi>Spain,</hi> being diſmiſſed without ranſome, and w<hi rend="sup">e</hi> this munificenſe &amp; liberalitie he had ſet at libertie aboue <hi>200.</hi> within y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>3.</hi> yeres tthat he raigned. I do now omit to tel you with what fauor &amp; curteſie he vſed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> priſoners, leaſt I be ouerlong, or may be carried too far with his loue. But y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> he néeds not my publication of his praiſe, the thing it ſelfe doth witneſſe: &amp; the hoſpital built for ſick Chriſtians, adioining to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of <hi>Marocco,</hi> &amp; endowed w<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gret reuenues, doth proue it
<pb facs="tcp:15178:87"/>manifeſtly. He died in the <hi>35.</hi> yéere of his age. When he had reigned not full <hi>3.</hi> yeeres, leauing a ſon of <hi>3.</hi> yéeres and an halfe olde, whoſe name is <hi>Iſmaell,</hi> &amp; as yet is it at this day brought vp with the Quéene his mother, the wife of <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delmelec</hi> at <hi>Argier.</hi> But as touching his nephew <hi>Muly Hamet,</hi> he was younger then <hi>Abdelmelec,</hi> being about xxix. or xxx. yéeres of age: of ſtature meane, of bodie weake, of coulour ſo blacke, that he was accompted of many for a <hi>Negro</hi> or black <hi>Moore.</hi> He was of a peruerſe nature, he would neuer ſpeak the trueth, he did all things ſubtelly and deceitfully. He was not delighted in armes, but as he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed in all battailes, of nature cowardly, and effeminate. But he ſo cruelly hated Chriſtians, that he would kil either with famine or nakedneſſe, thoſe that he caught. If that in theſe warres he being conſtreined by neceſſitie, gaue any ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of good will towards them, he did it againſt the heart, &amp; in a maner vnwillingly, that he might make them the more readie and chierfull to endaunger themſelues for him.</p>

And yet the Marques could not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand of the ſtate of the Iland: but afterward within night arriued to the Admirals Galeon a Pinaſſe, wherein was <hi>Domingo de Adutriaga,</hi> maiſter of a ſhippe called the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telina.</hi> Who brought a letter from <hi>Don Iohn de Caſtilio,</hi> containing as foloweth.</p>

The Marques did likewiſe vnderſtand by the ſaid Maiſter, that the Frenchmen the next day (hauing knowledge of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch of our army) had embarked themſelues in all haſt, &amp; that the two Galcons, and two great Carauels of <hi>Peter Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoto,</hi> were ouerthrowen néere vnto the caſtel, &amp; the French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men tooke the <hi>4.

The Marques being enformed of all theſe things, wrote vnto the Captaine, and gouernour, &amp; others in the caſtell by the ſayd maiſter, encouraging &amp; certifying them of the force of the kings army, not doubting but the next day to giue bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, and to haue the victorie, &amp; that therewith they ſhould hold themſelues contented, as he himſelfe was very ioyfull of the ſeruice which they had alreadie done to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king, which he knew ſhould not remaine vnrewarded. And with this anſwere they returned with the Pinaſſe to the Iland.</p>
               <p>The next day, being monday, &amp; the <hi>23.</hi> of Iuly, the two armies came to preſent battaile, the French armie hauing both the aduantage of the winde, &amp; alſo of the Sunne, came to aſſaile our nauie, being diuided into thrée eſquadrons, &amp; made three ſeuerall attempts, and yet could put nothing in execution. And towards night the Spaniſh army making towards the ſea, the French army placed ten ſhips alongſt the Iland, thinking that night to haue gotten the winde of
<pb facs="tcp:15178:92"/>vs, but by reaſon it was calme, they could not preuaile.</p>
               <p>The <hi>24.</hi> day of Iuly, the Marques returned, approching néerer the French armie, who hauing the aduantage of the winde, gaue two ſeuerall attempts, and yet put neither in execution. Then the Marques perceuing that the courſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the lande was not conuenient for him, he cauſed the armie to take the courſe towards the ſea, thinking with him ſelfe that whileſt his ſhippes were trimming of their ſailes, that the enimie would aſſault them, hauing the winde for their purpoſe, which fell out accordingly, for one of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch Captaines, with ſeuen Galeons, came to aſſaile the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the Spaniards, and the Galeon <hi>S.

They did hit our Captaine with foure ſhot, one in the foreſaile, an other in the ſhroudes, the thrid vppon an anker, the fourth on the ſhippes ſide, without doing any harme.

               <p>The ſame daye at night the armies did ſeperate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and the Marques determined at the going downe of the Moone to procure to get the winde of the French armie, and in the morning to aſſault them againe: which he dyd, ſo that the xxv. daye of Iuly, he found himſelfe to winde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of his enimies, &amp; ſo ſought to board them, but becauſe his ſhippes were great and heauie of ſaile, he could not put in effect that which he purpoſed, but was forced to returne to the reſcue of <hi>Don Chriſtopher de Fraſſo,</hi> who was in ſome diſtreſſe in folowing the enimie thorough default of his maine maſt: wherefore he gaue him a towe with his Captaine. This daye there was deſcried a great ſhippe of the enimies, which wanted her foremaſt, &amp; other two ſhips, that did helpe her, but they not being able to performe it, ſhe was forced to ſinke.

               <p>The xxvi. of Iuly, the French came againe to aſſault the Spaniſh armie in very good order, and with a fauourable winde.

Other reaſoned on the contrarie part, that all things doe depend on their firſt beginnings, that their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture would be infamous, and next cooſen to flat running awaye, that ſuſpition of feare was then vtterly to be ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, leaſt they did encreaſe the courage of the enimies, and bring their friends out of hart: that they were néere neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours vnto the mightie families of the <hi>Cunigames,</hi> and the <hi>Semples:</hi> and on the other ſide to <hi>Lenneux,</hi> the kings pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate patrimonie: that from thence thoſe that were next would come within few houres, and the reſt the next daye or at the fartheſt, within thrée dayes, that they would be a ſufficient guard, namely, with the helpe of the citizens, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the ſuccours farther off were come. This opinion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed at the Councell table. The French Ambaſſadour went to and fro betwéene both parties, rather like a ſpye, then a peacemaker, as he pretended. For when he ſawe at the firſt the forces at <hi>Glaſquo</hi> ſmall, and the power about <hi>Hamilton</hi> ſhewed greate, he vehemently encouraged the Quéene to giue battaile. Now had the Regent gathered together his friends out of the néerer parts, and looked for other out of <hi>Marchland</hi> and <hi>Lowthian.</hi> And when they wer come, being about <hi>600.</hi> very choice men, he graunting them but one day to reſt themſelues, minded ſo march to <hi>Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and out of hand to giue them battaile, if he could: for he thought delaye would be hurtfull to him and his, but profitable for the enimie, as whome the fartheſt parts of the kingdome did fauour.</p>
               <p>In the meane time he was aduertiſed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> next morning
<pb facs="tcp:15178:97"/>betimes before daie, that the enimies were gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from many places where they lodged, for they truſting in their number (for they had in armes aboue <hi>6500.</hi> and they knew that the Regent had not full <hi>4000</hi>) were determined for to march by <hi>Glaſquo,</hi> and leauing the Quéene in the Caſtle of <hi>Dunbritton,</hi> at the pleaſure either to ſight or draw forth the warres: or if the Regent (which they hoped not) would méete them in the waie, to giue him battaile, neither did they doubt of the euent of the fight. But he that had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued of himſelfe to prouoke them to battaile, as ſoone as he could bring forth his men, ſtoode certaine houres in araie of battaile before the Citie, in the open field, in the waie that he thought they would march. But when he ſawe that their army marched a long the farther ſide of the riuer, he ſtraight waie vnderſtanding their purpoſe, paſſed his footmen ouer the riuer by a bridge, and his horſemen by the foords, which were then frée of the tide of the Sea, and commanded them to march to <hi>Langſide.</hi> That is a ſtréete vppon the riuer of <hi>Carth,</hi> through which their enimies their waie laie, ſeated at the foote of an hil, on the Northweſt the Eaſt, &amp; the North with a deſcent, but on other partes decreaſing gentlie into a plaine. They haſted thether with ſo great ſpéed, that they had almoſt gotten the hill, before that their intent coulde be perceiued by the enimie, who alſo coucted that place, yea, and had the ſhorter waie. But two things happened ill for them, and well for vs: the firſt, that <hi>Gileſpicke Cambel</hi> the Earle of <hi>Argile,</hi> who was Generall of the Quéenes armie, being taken with a ſodaine paine had fallen downe into a ſound, and by his fall ſtaied the whole armie a while: the other was, that their armie being euer and anone downe in a bottome, could neuer ſée at one time all the kings armie: and therefore they taking it to be ſmall (as in truth it was) did both contemne it, and alſo the diſaduantage of the place. At length when the Quéenes armie drew néere, and ſawe that their enimie had gotten the place where they thought to haue lodged, they tooke another little hill ouer againſt it, and diuided their armie into two battailes. All the ſtrength they
<pb facs="tcp:15178:98"/>had they placed in their forward, wherewith if they coulde ouerthrowe the enimies battaile that ſtoode againſt it, they ſuppoſed that they ſhould conquere the reſt without fight, they being feared with the flight of their fellowes. The kings Chieftains had alſo diuided their armie into two bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes: in the battaile on the right hand were, <hi>Iames Doug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſſe,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Morton, Robert</hi> Lord <hi>Semple, Alexander</hi> Lord <hi>Hume, Patricke</hi> Lord <hi>Lindſey,</hi> with euerie one his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, and in the left, <hi>Iohn, Alexander, William,</hi> Earles of <hi>Mar, Gleucarne,</hi> and <hi>Taich,</hi> and the Citizens of <hi>Glaſquo:</hi> the harquebuſſiers kept the ſtréete below, and the gardems by the high waie. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both armies ſtood aranged, the Quéenes gunners being beaten fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their ground by the kings, aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned the place: and on the contrarie ſide, the kings horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men being inferiour to the Quéenes by one halfe, were not able to abide the charge, but fled. And when the Quéenes horſmen had thus diſcomfited their counterpartie, they aſſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to mount the hill, that they might alſo diſorder the ranges of the footmen, but being repelled by the kings archers, and a part of his horſemen, that had rallied and returned from their flight, they returned backe. In the meane time the left wing of the enimie diſmarching into the high waie, downe a long where the hill deſcendeth into a valley, did although that they were galled by the harquebuſſes, yet béeing got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten out of that ſtraight, ſpread forth their battailen. There the two eſquadrons hauing before them on both ſides a thicke trench of pikes, fought with ſuch vaior on both ſides for the ſpace of halfe an houre, the victorie inclining to neither parte, that thoſe that had broken their Pikes, dyd hurle their daggers, ſtones, and péeces of their Pikes, and finallie, whatſoeuer came to hand, at the heads of their eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
